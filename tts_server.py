"""AI4Bharat TTS -- FastAPI wrapper around coqui-tts's Synthesizer.

Matches the contract agent/tts.py's TTSClient expects: POST /synthesize
with {"text": ..., "lang": "bn"} -> raw WAV bytes.

Pilot single-L4 architecture (docs/adr/0001-pilot-single-l4-architecture.md):
one process serves all THREE languages -- bn, hi, en -- because AI4Bharat's
own Indic-TTS v1-checkpoints-release ships an English FastPitch+HiFi-GAN
checkpoint in the exact same coqui-tts format as Bengali and Hindi
(https://github.com/AI4Bharat/Indic-TTS/releases/tag/v1-checkpoints-release,
en.zip). That is simpler than the ADR's original assumption of a second,
NVIDIA-NeMo-based English TTS path, and this file supersedes that
assumption -- no second TTS MODEL FAMILY is needed.

It still needs its own PROCESS and VENV (/workspace/tts_venv), separate
from the orchestrator/ASR venv -- confirmed the hard way, not assumed:
coqui-tts needs transformers>=4.57 + huggingface_hub>=0.34, while the
AI4Bharat NeMo fork used for Bengali/Hindi ASR imports huggingface_hub's
ModelFilter, removed in huggingface_hub 0.24. No single version of either
package satisfies both consumers at once, so this cannot share an
environment with agent/asr.py's bn/hi models no matter how the two
libraries' own version constraints are pinned. See deploy/start_all.sh's
_run_tts.sh for the resulting process layout.

All three Synthesizers are loaded ONCE at module import (not per-request)
-- model load takes several seconds and holds real GPU memory, so this
must be a long-lived process,
not spawned per call.

WHY THIS DOES MORE THAN CALL synthesizer.tts()
----------------------------------------------
A single FastPitch pass over a whole multi-clause reply is what makes this
voice sound like a machine, and it is fixable without changing models:

* No breaths. FastPitch renders one flat prosodic contour across an entire
  utterance. Real speakers stop between clauses. Splitting on Bengali
  sentence and clause boundaries and inserting real silence is the single
  largest naturalness gain available here.
* Ragged padding. Each pass emits its own leading/trailing near-silence of
  arbitrary length, so naive concatenation produces gaps that are too long
  in some places and absent in others. Each chunk is trimmed, then padded
  by an amount chosen for the punctuation that ended it.
* Rushed delivery. length_scale 1.0 is noticeably fast for a service line
  a caller is trying to write a price down from. Slightly above 1 reads as
  measured rather than sluggish.
* Inconsistent level. Peak varies per utterance, which on a phone sounds
  like the speaker keeps moving. Normalizing to a fixed peak fixes it.

Every one of these is tunable per-request (see SynthesizeRequest) so the
settings can be A/B'd against a real handset without a redeploy.
