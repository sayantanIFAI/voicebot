"""Audit a call's spoken history against the records it was drawn from (KCD-500, KCD-501).

Every historical sentence the agent speaks is a template filled from a retrieved field, and
the call record (agent/call_record.py) stores the id of the field each one came from. This
tool checks that claim after the fact -- the audit the hallucination story asks for:

  * every statement id is either a fixed "cannot see / need to verify / ask" label, or the id
    of an event that is actually in the timeline that was retrieved for that call;
  * a `due:` statement exists only if a clinician-approved interval was retrieved;
  * nothing is recorded as spoken that the timeline could not have produced.

An ORPHAN is a statement id with no origin: the agent said something about the caller's
history that no retrieved field supports. A call with any orphan fails the audit.

    python tools/history_audit.py CALL_EVENTS.json TIMELINE.json [--statuses STATUS.json]

CALL_EVENTS.json   the call's record: a list of {"seq", "kind", "payload"}
TIMELINE.json      the response of GET /patients/{ref}/timeline for that call
STATUS.json        optional list of test-status responses retrieved during the call

Exit status 0 when every call is clean, 1 otherwise. `audit()` is the importable form.
