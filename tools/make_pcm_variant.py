"""Regenerate main_pcm.py from main.py by swapping ONLY the transport.

A script rather than a one-off hand edit because the two files have to
stay in sync while transport work and reasoning work proceed in parallel.
Re-run after any change to main.py and the PCM variant picks it up with
no merge.

The split is enforced, not merely intended: everything from
`_resolve_intent` downward must be byte-identical between the two files,
and this script refuses to write if that stops being true.

GENERATED FILE -- do not edit directly. Produced by
tools/make_pcm_variant.py from main.py; edit main.py and re-run that.

This variant changes only the TRANSPORT (how audio arrives and how the
turn detector reads it):
  * No ffmpeg, no WebM, no temp audio files, no subprocess per poll.
  * Appending is O(chunk) and reading the tail is O(tail), where the WebM
    path was O(call length) EVERY poll -- O(T^2) per call.
  * The sample index IS the timeline, exactly, so processed_until_s
    cannot drift away from real time.
See agent/pcm_buffer.py for the argument and the arithmetic.

    """One PCM buffer for the ENTIRE call, and a marker for how much of it
    has been consumed.

    The continuous-buffer design is inherited from the WebM version, where
    it was forced: MediaRecorder puts the container header only in the
    first chunk, so resetting the buffer mid-call produced audio that
    could never be decoded again. That constraint is GONE here -- raw PCM
    has no header and any byte range is independently valid.

    It is kept anyway, because the second reason for it was always the
    better one: `processed_until_s` gives every turn an absolute,
    monotonic position on one call-long timeline. Silero's segment
    boundaries move as more audio arrives, so a turn detector run against
    a buffer that keeps restarting drops any utterance straddling the
    seam. Each poll therefore looks only at the UNPROCESSED TAIL.

    What PCM changes is the cost and the accuracy of that lookup: the tail
    is a slice rather than a full re-decode, and sample index maps to
    wall-clock exactly, so the timeline cannot drift.
