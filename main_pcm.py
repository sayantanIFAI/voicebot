"""Kolkata Care Diagnostics -- voice agent on the RAW PCM transport.

GENERATED FILE -- do not edit directly. Produced by
tools/make_pcm_variant.py from main.py; edit main.py and re-run that.

This variant changes only the TRANSPORT (how audio arrives and how the
turn detector reads it):
  * No ffmpeg, no WebM, no temp audio files, no subprocess per poll.
  * Appending is O(chunk) and reading the tail is O(tail), where the WebM
    path was O(call length) EVERY poll -- O(T^2) per call.
  * The sample index IS the timeline, exactly, so processed_until_s
    cannot drift away from real time.
See agent/pcm_buffer.py for the argument and the arithmetic.

----------------------------------------------------------------------


Turn loop, once a caller's utterance is judged complete (agent/vad_stream.py):

  utterance WAV -> ASR (agent/asr.py, IndicConformer)
                -> intent+slots (agent/llm.py, Ollama JSON-mode,
                   fronted by agent/semantic_cache.py)
                -> Spring Boot lookup (agent/tools_client.py) -- ALWAYS
                   live, never cached; see semantic_cache.py's docstring
                -> reply text, TEMPLATED from the API response, never
                   restated by the model (agent/reply_templates.py)
                -> TTS (agent/tts.py) -> WAV bytes back over the socket

Every stage has a named failure path (see _dispatch_turn) so a caller never
gets dead air: ASR-empty, LLM-failure, tool-failure and TTS-failure each
speak a distinct, pre-recorded apology rather than the process hanging or
the socket just going quiet. See README.md "Error handling" for the full
table and the reasoning behind each choice.

HALF-DUPLEX GATE
----------------
The mic is open for the entire call, and the agent's replies play out of
the caller's speaker. With no gate, the agent hears itself: its own
greeting lands in the same buffer the turn detector is watching, so VAD
fires a "the caller finished talking" on the agent's own voice, ASR
transcribes the agent, and processed_until_s advances past audio the
caller never produced. That is a self-sustaining loop, and it is what
made real calls cut the caller off in the first second and then run a
turn behind for the rest of the call.

Browser echoCancellation does not save this. It is built to cancel a
remote WebRTC peer's rendered stream; here the audio is synthesized
locally and played through Web Audio, which the canceller never sees as a
far-end reference.

So the pipeline is explicitly half-duplex, gated from BOTH ends:
  * client mutes the mic track while agent audio is playing (static/
    index.html) -- the track stays live and keeps emitting, so the WebM
    timeline never breaks, it just carries silence;
  * server refuses to run turn detection while `agent_speaking`, then
    resynchronizes processed_until_s past the muted region once playback
    is confirmed finished.

The cost is no barge-in: a caller cannot interrupt the agent mid-sentence.
That is a real limitation, chosen deliberately over the alternative, which
was a system that interrupted ITSELF. Supporting barge-in properly needs
an acoustic echo canceller with the played audio as a reference signal
(WebRTC APM or speex AEC), which is a much larger change.

    The continuous-buffer design is inherited from the WebM version, where

    first chunk, so resetting the buffer mid-call produced audio that
    could never be decoded again. That constraint is GONE here -- raw PCM
    has no header and any byte range is independently valid.

    It is kept anyway, because the second reason for it was always the
    better one: `processed_until_s` gives every turn an absolute,
    monotonic position on one call-long timeline. Silero's segment
    boundaries move as more audio arrives, so a turn detector run against
    a buffer that keeps restarting drops any utterance straddling the
    seam. Each poll therefore looks only at the UNPROCESSED TAIL.

    What PCM changes is the cost and the accuracy of that lookup: the tail
    is a slice rather than a full re-decode, and sample index maps to
    wall-clock exactly, so the timeline cannot drift.
