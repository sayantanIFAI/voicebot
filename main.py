"""Kolkata Care Diagnostics -- Bengali voice agent, WebSocket orchestrator.

Turn loop, once a caller's utterance is judged complete (agent/vad_stream.py):

  utterance WAV -> ASR (agent/asr.py, IndicConformer)
                -> intent+slots (agent/llm.py, Ollama JSON-mode,
                   fronted by agent/semantic_cache.py)
                -> Spring Boot lookup (agent/tools_client.py) -- ALWAYS
                   live, never cached; see semantic_cache.py's docstring
                -> reply text, TEMPLATED from the API response, never
                   restated by the model (agent/reply_templates.py)
                -> TTS (agent/tts.py) -> WAV bytes back over the socket

Every stage has a named failure path (see _dispatch_turn) so a caller never
gets dead air: ASR-empty, LLM-failure, tool-failure and TTS-failure each
speak a distinct, pre-recorded apology rather than the process hanging or
the socket just going quiet. See README.md "Error handling" for the full
table and the reasoning behind each choice.

HALF-DUPLEX GATE
----------------
The mic is open for the entire call, and the agent's replies play out of
the caller's speaker. With no gate, the agent hears itself: its own
greeting lands in the same buffer the turn detector is watching, so VAD
fires a "the caller finished talking" on the agent's own voice, ASR
transcribes the agent, and processed_until_s advances past audio the
caller never produced. That is a self-sustaining loop, and it is what
made real calls cut the caller off in the first second and then run a
turn behind for the rest of the call.

Browser echoCancellation does not save this. It is built to cancel a
remote WebRTC peer's rendered stream; here the audio is synthesized
locally and played through Web Audio, which the canceller never sees as a
far-end reference.

So the pipeline is explicitly half-duplex, gated from BOTH ends:
  * client mutes the mic track while agent audio is playing (static/
    index.html) -- the track stays live and keeps emitting, so the WebM
    timeline never breaks, it just carries silence;
  * server refuses to run turn detection while `agent_speaking`, then
    resynchronizes processed_until_s past the muted region once playback
    is confirmed finished.

The cost is no barge-in: a caller cannot interrupt the agent mid-sentence.
That is a real limitation, chosen deliberately over the alternative, which
was a system that interrupted ITSELF. Supporting barge-in properly needs
an acoustic echo canceller with the played audio as a reference signal
(WebRTC APM or speex AEC), which is a much larger change.
