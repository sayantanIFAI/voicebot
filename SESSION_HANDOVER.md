# SESSION HANDOVER — uncommitted work, 2026-09-23

**For:** a fresh Claude session (or engineer) picking up exactly where this
session left off. **Not** a replacement for `HANDOVER.md` — that file is the
pod-verified, ground-truth doc per `CLAUDE.md` §2 authority order. This file
is narrower and younger: it exists because `HANDOVER.md` (last written
2026-09-08/09-15) is now stale against everything below, and none of it has
been verified on a live pod, so it must not be blended into that file as if
it were pod-verified fact.

**Read `CLAUDE.md` first, then this file, then `HANDOVER.md` for the
baseline.** Where this file and `HANDOVER.md` disagree about what the code
can do today (multilingual support, barge-in, "1 built · 39 partial · 113
absent"), trust this file — `HANDOVER.md`'s "It cannot" list in particular is
now out of date and should be refreshed by whoever next has pod access.

## 1. Repo state right now

```
branch: epic-e26-booking-reschedule-cancel
remotes: origin -> sayantanIFAI/ivr.git, voicebot -> sayantanIFAI/voicebot.git
last commit: d67eaea "Multi-question/follow-up conversation handling,
             answer-quality fixes, and CodeRabbit security/correctness fixes"
working tree: 26 modified files + 15 new untracked files, NONE committed
```

Everything described in §2–§4 below is **uncommitted, local-only**. Run
`git status --short` before doing anything destructive. Nothing here has
been pushed since `d67eaea`.

Full local test suite (excludes `tests/test_smoke.py`, which needs live pod
services and is not runnable off-pod — see `scripts/gate.sh`):

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/test_smoke.py -q
```

Last run: **463 passed, 0 failed.** Re-run this yourself before trusting it —
don't take a prior session's word for a number that changes with every edit.

## 2. What this session actually built (uncommitted)

Three epics from the backlog — **Call Intelligence**, **Channels and Written
Confirmations**, **Conversation Latency as the Caller Feels It** — plus a
batch of fixes from a second CodeRabbit review pass on PR #1. All new
`agent/` modules are pure-Python, unit-tested, and import nothing from
`main.py` (the one-import rule holds). Everything touching `main.py` was
verified with `python -m py_compile main.py` and regenerated into
`main_pcm.py` via `python tools/make_pcm_variant.py` — **never edit
`main_pcm.py` directly**, it is generated.

### New files (untracked)
| File | Story | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `agent/call_state.py` | KCD-061 | Per-call `CallState` (language, confidence, channel quality, senior/caller-state signals) |
| `agent/code_switch.py` | KCD-065 | Text-based script-mixture detection (bn/hi/en bucket) |
| `agent/channel_quality.py` | KCD-075 | FFT-based clean/narrowband/noisy/crosstalk classification |
| `agent/detector_budget.py` | KCD-076 | `asyncio.wait_for`-based time-budget wrapper for any detector |
| `agent/latency_metrics.py` | KCD-469 | Per-language turn-latency p50/p95 |
| `agent/clause_split.py` | KCD-462 | Splits a long reply into clauses at sentence punctuation |
| `agent/filler.py` | KCD-461 | Pure async race: speak a filler if a slow stage exceeds a threshold, suppressed if the real result arrives first |
| `tests/test_*.py` (7 files) | — | Unit tests for the above, all passing, no network/GPU |

### Modified files, grouped by what changed
- **`main.py` / `main_pcm.py`** (267 lines each, same diff by construction):
  `CallState` wiring into `_dispatch_turn`; channel-quality classification
  budgeted at 0.08s; code-switch/channel-quality/fast-path-served counters;
  `/api/health` now reports `ready`/`startup_duration_s`; `/api/stats`
  extended with `insufficient_information`, `code_switch_buckets`,
  `channel_quality_buckets`, `detector_budget`, `turn_latency_by_language`,
  and (this session) `barge_in_interrupts`; `_speak()` rewritten to stream
  a reply clause-by-clause (KCD-462) instead of one TTS call per reply;
  `_await_with_filler()` now wraps the **whole** cache-then-LLM sequence in
  `_resolve_intent`, not just the LLM call (KCD-459 — a slow embedding
  lookup used to burn into the filler threshold silently); `_handle_control`
  gained an `"interrupt"` control-message branch (KCD-464, see §3).
- **`agent/fast_path.py`, `agent/outcome_metrics.py`, `agent/phrases.py`**:
  `_serve()`/`fast_path_served` per-intent counter (KCD-460);
  `barge_in_interrupts` counter added; `please_wait` filler phrase reworded
  per explicit instruction (bn "আচ্ছা, ঠিক আছে", hi "ठीक है", en "Let me
  check, please." — the English wording was a judgment call, the request
  said "let me please" verbatim, which read as a stray fragment).
- **`static/index.html`**: manual "Stop, let me talk" interrupt button
  (KCD-464, see §3) plus the clause-streaming-aware `pendingClips` counter
  that was already correct before this session (verified, not rebuilt).
- **`agent/llm.py`, `agent/phonetic_match.py`, `clinic-api/*.py`,
  `tests/test_*.py`**: the second-batch CodeRabbit fixes — see §4, all
  10 findings there were independently verified against current code
  before being applied (one was disproven-then-reproven: the "NFC
  decomposes flap consonants" claim looked backwards until checked with
  `unicodedata.normalize` directly — it's correct, Bengali/Devanagari flap
  letters are in Unicode's NFC composition exclusion list).
- **Doctor-side "ask correct questions back"** (`clinic-api/main.py`,
  `agent/reply_templates.py`, `agent/reply_templates_i18n.py`): tests
  already had ambiguous-name clarification (KCD-446); doctors didn't.
  Added `_find_doctor_candidates`/`_doctor_suggestions` mirroring the
  test-side logic, so two similarly-spelled doctors now trigger a "which
  one did you mean" reply instead of `_find_doctor` silently picking one —
  the "Doctor Nobody" bug class `CLAUDE.md` §1 already warns about.

---

## 3. KCD-464 — read this before assuming barge-in works

`main.py`'s own module docstring (§ "HALF-DUPLEX GATE") explains the mic is
muted client-side for the **entire** duration the agent is speaking, and
there is no acoustic echo canceller — so the server structurally cannot
detect a caller talking over the agent. That constraint was **not** removed
this session and cannot be removed without real AEC infrastructure (a much
larger change, already flagged as such in that same docstring).

What was added instead: a visible **manual** interrupt button
(`static/index.html`) that, when tapped, immediately stops local playback,
unmutes the mic, and sends `{"type": "interrupt"}` over the control
WebSocket; `main.py`'s `_handle_control` treats it exactly like
`playback_done` (releases the gate early) and records it in the new
`barge_in_interrupts` counter. **This is a UI affordance, not acoustic
barge-in.** Don't describe it as barge-in to anyone without this caveat —
it was built and presented to the user with this distinction explicit.

## 4. Second CodeRabbit review batch — all 10 findings, verified and fixed

Every finding below was checked against current code (not taken on faith)
before fixing; none were false positives, all 10 were applied:

1. `agent/llm.py` — `secondary_slots.faq_topic` wasn't validated against
   `FAQ_TOPICS` (the primary slots' version already was) — an invented
   topic could 404 through `_tools.get_faq` into a wrong `tool_failure`
   reply instead of an ordinary re-ask.
2. `agent/phonetic_match.py` + `clinic-api/phonetic_match.py` (deliberately
   duplicated, kept in sync by hand — see that file's own docstring) — flap
   consonants (ড়/ঢ়/ड़/ढ़) silently misclassified after NFC normalization
   because Unicode excludes them from NFC composition. Fixed in both
   scripts, both files, with 2 new regression tests built from explicit
   codepoints (typed glyphs would silently hide the exact bug being
   tested — this bit once already while drafting the fix, see `git diff`
   history on `tests/test_phonetic_match.py` if curious).
3. `clinic-api/booking_migrate.py` — no PostgreSQL branch existed for the
   partial-unique-index migration; an existing Postgres database would
   either crash on SQLite-only `PRAGMA` calls or (with a naive dialect
   guard alone) silently keep the old blanket constraint forever. Added a
   real Postgres branch (`DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS` + `CREATE UNIQUE
   INDEX ... WHERE`).
4. `clinic-api/booking_service.py` — `_release_expired_hold` was a
   read-then-delete-by-primary-key with no DB-side re-check, a real TOCTOU
   race under SQLite's legacy transaction mode. Converted to a single
   filtered `DELETE`.
5. `clinic-api/enquiry_migrate.py` — `BOOLEAN ... DEFAULT 1/0` rejected by
   PostgreSQL; changed to `TRUE`/`FALSE`.
6. `clinic-api/models.py` — the partial unique index only had
   `sqlite_where`; added `postgresql_where` too, for a **brand-new**
   Postgres database (an existing one still needs #3's migration branch).
7. **Eight** test fixtures were missing `enquiry_migrate` (and in one case
   `booking_migrate`) from their per-test module-eviction list, letting a
   stale migration module leak across tests and target the wrong SQLite
   engine. CodeRabbit named 4 files; the same pattern was found by
   inspection in 4 more (`test_booking_concurrency.py`,
   `test_booking_authorization.py`, `test_booking_service.py`,
   `test_clinic_matching_i18n.py`) and fixed for consistency, not just the
   ones named.
8. `tests/test_booking_service.py` + `tests/test_booking_concurrency.py` —
   `_next_weekday`-style helpers started their search from *today*, which
   could select today's date after today's chamber hours had already
   passed, silently emptying `available_slots()`. Changed to start
   tomorrow — same fix pattern already applied earlier this session to a
   different helper (`_next_weekday_with_schedule`).
9. `tests/test_digit_fidelity.py` — `PHONE_CORPUS` was built from an
   unseeded `random.randint`, so a failing generated case couldn't be
   reproduced. Seeded with `random.Random(445)`.
10. `tests/test_doctor_matching_e29.py` — the "badly garbled surname" test
    queried "Roy" exactly, which matches `_find_doctor`'s first (exact
    substring) branch and never reached fuzzy/phonetic matching at all —
    a false-confidence test that couldn't have caught a regression in the
    code path it claimed to test. Verified CodeRabbit's own suggested
    replacement independently (`difflib` ratio 0.588 for "Nukharji" vs
    "Mukherjee", confirmed below `FUZZY_SURNAME_FLOOR=0.60` and above
    `PHONETIC_ASSISTED_FLOOR=0.45`, confirmed same phonetic key) before
    applying it.

---

## 5. Open loops — pick one of these next

1. **Nothing is committed.** The user has not yet said whether to commit
   and push this batch. Ask before doing so — don't assume.
2. **The very first CodeRabbit review this session ever triggered** (on an
   earlier commit, via `@coderabbitai full review`) was never checked/
   reported back to the user — that's a loop from earlier in the day that
   is still technically open, separate from the second review batch in §4
   (which WAS fully handled).
3. **KCD-466 (queue position at peak)** — the user explicitly said "do not
   do anything" here. `agent/admission.py`/`docs/adr/0001` deliberately
   never queues a call (refused call → human, immediately). Do not build a
   queue without the user re-opening this and asking for a new ADR.
4. **Everything touching `main.py`/`main_pcm.py` this session is compiled
   and regenerated but not run against live ASR/TTS/Ollama/clinic-api** —
   no pod exists right now (see `HANDOVER.md` §12 pattern: pods are
   ephemeral, get a fresh one from the RunPod console, don't trust any
   hardcoded IP). Treat every latency/behavior claim above as "proven by
   local unit tests", not "proven live", until someone runs
   `tests/test_smoke.py` on a real pod.
5. **`HANDOVER.md` itself is stale** — its "It cannot: ... Speak anything
   but Bengali... Be interrupted" section predates the multilingual
   routing (`agent/lid.py`, `agent/asr_router.py`) and this session's
   interrupt affordance. Whoever next has pod access should refresh it —
   don't hand-wave a rewrite without re-measuring the numbers in its
   "Measured numbers" table, that table's whole value is that it's real.

## 6. Gotchas specific to this working tree

- **`gh` CLI** is installed but not on `PATH` in either Bash or PowerShell
  on this machine — invoke it at
  `C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe` by full path.
- **Editing `agent/phonetic_match.py` or `clinic-api/phonetic_match.py`
  with the `Edit` tool's exact-string match is fragile** — mixed
  Bengali/Devanagari/Latin content in one file occasionally fails an
  exact match for reasons that aren't visually obvious (normalization
  form of a typed/pasted glyph is not guaranteed stable). When it happens,
  drop to a small Python script that reads/replaces/writes the file with
  explicit `\uXXXX` escapes and verifies the byte content afterward
  (`[hex(ord(c)) for c in s]`) rather than fighting the editor on a retry.
- **`main.py` cannot be imported or run in this dev environment** —
  torchaudio isn't installed here. The verification discipline for any
  `main.py` change is `py_compile` + `tools/make_pcm_variant.py`
  regeneration + stating it's "pending live verification", never claiming
  a `main.py` change is proven by a passing local test suite alone.
- **`tests/test_smoke.py` needs live services** (`localhost:8080` clinic-api,
  a running Ollama, a running voice-agent process) and will show ~20+
  failures off-pod. That's expected — `scripts/gate.sh` itself only runs
  it when `VOICE_AGENT_ON_POD=1` is set. Don't mistake those failures for
  regressions from anything in this session's diff.

---

## 7. Update -- later the same day (read this before trusting section 2)

Sections 1-6 describe the state at commit `02d7ae1`. Everything below was
built AFTER it. Same rule as before: proven by local unit tests, not on a pod.

### Done, tested, and wired into the call path
| Story | What | Where |
|---|---|---|
| KCD-483..488 (E32) | 483/484/485 verified already satisfied; **486** post-commit write verification + hold/escalate; **487** fault-injection test; **488** versioned `CancellationPolicy` table. Also fixed `classify_yes_no("not sure") -> "yes"`. | `clinic-api/booking_service.py`, `models.py`, `agent/booking_flow.py` |
| KCD-162 / 164 | Prosody logic extracted to `agent/prosody.py` and made testable; `.` sentence splitting, punctuation-aware pauses, every parameter per-request tunable. Audio cache pre-warm fixed to warm the SAME clauses `_speak` sends (my KCD-462 change had silently broken it). | `agent/prosody.py`, `tts_server.py`, `agent/tts.py` |
| KCD-157 | Phone/ID grouping. **Fixed a real bug: `speed=0.8` was being sent as Coqui `length_scale`, so prices/phones were spoken ~35% FASTER, not slower.** Server now treats `speed` as a rate. | `agent/figures.py`, `agent/prosody.resolve_length_scale` |
| KCD-149 / 155 / 084 / 087 | Appendix C speech policy, acknowledgement templates, senior-voice detector + persistence (`Patient.senior_mode`), language policy. | `agent/speech_policy.py`, `acknowledgement.py`, `senior_voice.py`, `language_policy.py` |
| KCD-159 | Explicit pronunciation path (lexicon + acronym spelling; unknown words still block, KCD-455). | `agent/pronunciation.py` |
| Audio robustness | Cross-talk (two-pitch) detection, Wiener-style noise filter + level gain, jumbled-transcript detection, and **empathetic re-ask (twice) before any hand-off**. | `agent/audio_quality.py`, `agent/reask_policy.py` |

### NOT done -- do not report these as complete
- **KCD-321** kill switch (per-intent/department, non-engineer UI, clean finish of in-flight calls)
- **KCD-322** graceful drain on SIGTERM
- **KCD-326** per-call resource bounds
- **KCD-151** per-language verbalisation table registry + table-driven tests
- **KCD-160 / 167** voice identity document + automated audio-fingerprint drift check
- **KCD-161** first-clause streaming synthesis on the TTS server
- **KCD-163** cancellable synthesis/playback (note: after a manual interrupt the server can still send already-rendered clauses)
- **KCD-131 / 132** External-gated (real hospital/lab systems)
- **KCD-150** External-gated (native-reviewer sign-off); KCD-159's 200-term sign-off also pending. ~70 lexicon entries exist, all unreviewed.

### Things a reviewer must know
- Every audio threshold (`audio_quality.py`, `senior_voice.py`) is REASONED and validated on SYNTHETIC signals only. The cross-talk THRESHOLD (0.05) is REASONED: it was placed inside the gap between two scores measured on SYNTHETIC signals only (single voices <= 0.012, two-talker mixes >= 0.13). The scores are synthetic-measured; the threshold is not calibrated on real audio, and real handset audio has not been validated. Recalibrate on real calls before trusting.
- `senior_voice.py` is a heuristic prior, not an age classifier. It needs evidence over >= 2 clips, or an explicit request/stated age.
- One existing test assertion was changed on purpose: `tests/test_speech_norm.py` pinned the *ungrouped* phone reading, which KCD-157 deliberately changes.
- `/api/v1/patients/senior` is unauthenticated like every other clinic-api endpoint (Epic E14 gap); it exposes only a delivery-mode boolean per phone number.
- `main.py` changes are compiled + PCM-regenerated + checked for undefined names; they are not exercised end-to-end.


---

## Update: audio, persona, identity and patient-history stories

Built after `1ae1db4`. Same rule as above: proven by off-pod unit tests (1122 pass), not on a
pod. **Every threshold below is REASONED or measured on SYNTHETIC audio; none is calibrated on
real telephone speech.** Each module's docstring says which.

### Done, tested, wired into `main.py` (and regenerated `main_pcm.py`)
| Stories | What | Where |
|---|---|---|
| KCD-046/048/050 | Pure-Python turn-end logic (guards, semantic endpointing, audio-driven wake-ups instead of 0.5 s polling); half-duplex `PlaybackGate` | `agent/endpointing.py`, `playback_gate.py`, `vad_stream.py` |
| KCD-051/052 | Echo cancellation (partitioned adaptive filter, GCC-PHAT delay, double-talk protection, residual suppression) and barge-in detection; client sends `aec` config | `agent/echo_cancel.py`, `barge_in.py`, `full_duplex.py`, `static/pcm/` |
| KCD-047 | Endpoint calibration tool (needs >= 200 real annotated recordings; result stays REASONED until then) | `agent/endpoint_calibration.py`, `tools/calibrate_endpointing.py` |
| KCD-053/054 | Cross-talk marking + near-end profile; speaker-change detection that revokes verification | `agent/near_end.py`, `speaker_change.py`, `identity.py`, `golden_buckets.py` |
| KCD-055/057 | Noise suppression (guarded) and level normalisation. **OFF by default.** | `agent/conditioning.py`, `level.py`, `tools/conditioning_eval.py` |
| KCD-353/511-514 | Persona-as-code, apology enforcement, templated acknowledgements, AI disclosure, deterministic human-request detection. Wording is DRAFT pending native/clinical/legal review | `agent/persona.py`, `apology.py`, `turn_ack.py`, `disclosure.py`, `human_request.py`, `docs/persona.md` |
| KCD-493-501 (E33) | Read-model timeline with provenance, identify/resolve (exact first, sound-alike only as a flagged suggestion), history gated on verification, preferences, continuity, test history without results, call record, hallucination suite | `clinic-api/patient_context.py`, `agent/patient_context.py`, `history_*.py`, `call_record.py`, `tools/history_audit.py`, `tests/test_history_hallucination.py` |
| KCD-019 | Capacity model. **States UNDETERMINED until the bake-off throughputs are supplied.** | `tools/capacity_model.py`, `docs/capacity-measurements.template.json` |

### New environment flags (all default to the safe/old behaviour)
`AEC_BARGE_IN` (off), `SEMANTIC_ENDPOINTING` (off), `CONDITION_INPUT` (off), `ACTIVE_POLL_INTERVAL_S`,
`TURN_TAIL_GUARD_S` (0.3 s; PCM variant 0.1 s), `PRONUNCIATION_ALLOW_DRAFT` (off).

### External dependencies -- why these stories are not "done"
- **Real recordings:** KCD-047 (200 narrowband, labelled turn ends), KCD-053/054 (real rooms, real single-speaker calls), KCD-055/057 (pod ASR WER before/after), AEC (real handset ERLE via `tools/echo_eval.py --pairs`).
- **Native / clinical / legal review:** KCD-511/512 (persona, register), KCD-353 (disclosure wording, `DISCLOSURE_VERSION = 1.0-draft`).
- **Other systems:** KCD-203 verifier (KCD-495 speaks no history without it), KCD-131 hospital connector (KCD-493), real caller ID (KCD-494), branch data (KCD-497), clinician-approved retest intervals (KCD-498; without them "due" is never said), SIP/SBC transfer (KCD-353).
- **Bake-off throughput:** KCD-019.

### Findings a reviewer must know
- **Capacity:** with the ADR's own workload and a REASONED 1.5x peak factor, the default `ADMISSION_MAX_CALLS=28` sends about 16% of calls to a person in an average hour and about 39% in the busiest (`python tools/capacity_model.py`).
- The existing `lookup_booking` path still authorises by the phone number the caller states. The verification gate applies to the NEW history path only.
- Two readback templates exceed the persona sentence cap (bn 17 words, hi 23); recorded as a ratchet (`KNOWN_LONG_SENTENCE_TEMPLATES = 2`), not reworded.
- The older two-pitch cross-talk test flags one of 24 synthetic single-voice clips (0.16 s); the new pitch-alternation evidence does not fire on any. Bounded in `tests/test_near_end.py`.
- Barge-in: a car horn over rumble can still cause a false event; a street-noise test bounds it at 9 per minute or fewer.
- **External "no guessing" review -- what was fixed** (`tests/test_no_guess.py`, `tests/test_tts_concurrency.py`):
  - ASR confidence is three-state (`agent/confidence_gate.py`): a single decoder's text (`ctc_fallback`, or a single-decoder model) is UNAVAILABLE, never trusted like two agreeing decoders. All fact retrievals are gated, not four intents. On UNAVAILABLE the agent reads the entity back (`agent/entity_confirmation.py`) and runs the lookup only after a yes; on LOW it refuses. **Consequence: if the pod's English model has no CTC decoder, every English factual question costs one extra confirmation turn.**
  - Fuzzy and phonetic matches SUGGEST, never resolve, for doctors and tests (`clinic-api/main.py`). Whole-name-token match wins ("Sen" vs "Sengupta"); several substring matches are ambiguous, not `.first()`; fragments under 3 letters identify nobody. Two existing tests that pinned auto-resolution of a sound-alike were changed on purpose (spec change), marked as such.
  - Emergency: `agent/emergency.py` runs on every transcript, all three languages, any confidence, before any model call; it clears the booking, speaks a fixed notice, hands over (`emergency` caller state now valid). **Runs on a finished transcript, not streaming audio; phrase lists and the notice wording (names 112) are DRAFT pending clinical and native review.**
  - TTS: a per-language lock around set-`length_scale`-and-synthesize (the race was real: the test fails without it). Stated cost: same-language requests render one at a time -- measure in the load test.
  - Clinic API: service-token auth on `/api/v1/*` (`CLINIC_API_TOKEN` / `CLINIC_API_REQUIRE_TOKEN=1`; health stays open; open with a warning when unset). Internal services bind loopback (`INTERNAL_BIND_HOST`); `ONLY_PCM=1` starts one media entrypoint. **The token authenticates the orchestrator to the API, not the phone caller.**
  - `confirm_booking` is idempotent on the hold token (a retry returns the same confirmation, not "hold expired" and not a second booking).
- **NOT fixed from that review -- these need decisions, systems or data this repository does not have:** replacing per-utterance language ID with streaming multilingual code-switch ASR; streaming TTS and streaming end-of-turn from the first packet; SIP/RTP media, DTMF, real call transfer; a streaming safety channel on the audio; one global admission counter across processes (needs a shared store); a production database and the real HIS/LIS integration; OTP or other patient identity verification (KCD-203) -- so `lookup_booking` still authorises by the number the caller states; canonical entity IDs end to end; a real West Bengal telephone evaluation corpus; the release gates with critical-entity metrics.
- Test infrastructure: `tests/_pod_stubs.py` now puts the repo root first while it imports the orchestrator, because `main` also names `clinic-api/main.py`.

## Update: security questions, patient registry, senior care, operator wording, audio algorithms

Built after the "no guessing" fixes. Off-pod tests only; **every audio threshold below is REASONED and was
checked on SYNTHETIC audio.** End to end: `tests/test_orchestrator_security.py` runs the real orchestrator
against a real clinic API with the sample patients (speech, language model and TTS are faked).
`python tools/demo_patient_history.py` prints the sample data working.

| Story | What | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 495 / 497 | Security questions: the SERVER accepts two matching facts (patient id, date of birth, full name, address), one strong; never says which was wrong; 3 evaluations per call, 6 failures per patient per 24 h lock it. A number that finds nobody: the caller's details locate the record, then verify it. History is refused by the server until the call has verified that patient. | `clinic-api/registry.py`, `agent/security_check.py`, `agent/security_input.py` (spoken dates in bn/hi/en) |
| 493 / 498 / 499 | Tables: registry, medicines, patient medicines, test performances, history, one-day cache, verification sessions, messages, audit. Sample patients seeded on an EMPTY registry only. Medicines and tests are stated as facts with dates, never a dose or a result. Preferences are offered after the answer, applied only on yes. | `clinic-api/models.py`, `patient_seed.py`, `patient_context.py` |
| 496 / 501 | When a call closes: history rows, a cache entry kept ONE day, an audit row. A booking still being collected at hang-up is saved; after verification the next call OFFERS to continue it. | `registry.finalize_call`, `main.py: _save_unfinished_draft`, `_offer_unfinished` |
| 500 | "Sorry. I am unable to find the details. Could you please guide me, so that I can help you?" wherever nothing is found. | `agent/history_templates.py` |
| 512 | Age from the registered date of birth (server-computed, 60 and over) turns on senior care: slower policy, warm opening once, kind closing on every second answer, patience on a re-ask. | `agent/senior_care.py` |
| 513 / 514 / 057 | "Thank you for telling me" opens every substantive reply (`ACK_MODE=always`; `varied` restores the old behaviour). Every apology is "Sorry." plus one short sentence. "Speak a little louder" in three languages. | `agent/turn_ack.py`, `apology.py`, `phrases.py` |
| 353 | Greeting: Sonoscan Vaani, automated, staff available, 112 pointer. Any phrase (disclosure, cannot-find, thanks, ...) can be changed from the database with no deploy; the call record stores which wording was heard. `tools/check_messages.py` runs the persona checks on a change. | `agent/messages.py`, `clinic-api/agent_messages.py` |
| 047 | Adaptive pause: learns each caller's own pauses (p90 of the gaps inside their utterances, plus evidence of cuts made too early) and waits accordingly. Does NOT replace the measured calibration. | `agent/pause_profile.py` |
| 053 / 055 | Near-end attention: frames far below the caller's own level that are another voice or unvoiced hiss in a pause are attenuated 18 dB; the caller's own speech is left bit-for-bit and consonants are protected. | `agent/attention.py` |
| 054 | Speaker change also uses pitch and level as a corroborating cue. | `agent/speaker_change.py` |
| 511 | `/speakers` endpoint and `tools/audition_voices.py`; the voice is chosen by ear. | `tts_server.py` |
| review | A single sound-alike suggestion ("did you mean Dr. Mukherjee?") is remembered so a "yes" runs the lookup. Suggestions carry Bengali and Hindi script. | `main.py: _note_suggestion` |

### Things a reviewer must know
- Real bugs these tests found and fixed: a date read out ("12 May 1980") was also read as a patient id; Indic
  words were cut into pieces by `\w` when matching names and addresses (Hindi verification failed); a bare "yes"
  answering the unfinished-booking offer was re-asked as a jumbled transcript; **the PCM generator silently
  dropped `_condition_wav_to_path` (and would have dropped `_attend_wav_to_path`)** -- a NameError the moment
  either was switched on; `messages.load` crashed on a malformed body.
- Spec changes made on purpose to existing tests, each marked in the test: the acknowledgement (always the
  thanks), the "cannot see" wording, and the history tests that assumed an unverified caller is offered a
  person now run with `SECURITY_QUESTIONS=off` (they still cover that mode).
- The DB message rows are seeded from the code defaults at first start; after that the database wins, so a
  later change to a built-in default does not reach a running deployment until the row is edited.
- The sample patients are invented; `CLINIC_SEED_SAMPLE_PATIENTS=0` for a real database. The one sample retest
  interval says `approved_by = "SAMPLE DATA"`: it is not a clinician's decision.
- Still needs the pod or people: `docs/pod-verification-checklist.md`; emergency wording approval:
  `docs/emergency-for-approval.md`; native review of all new wording; real recordings for every audio threshold.
- Not done: preferences are offered and recorded but branch, channel and address are not yet applied to a
  booking; the "continue it" offer restores the saved slots but does not re-hold a slot.
