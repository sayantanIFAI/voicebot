"""DB session setup.

Defaults to SQLite ON THE NETWORK VOLUME, not Postgres. That is a
deliberate reversal, and the reasoning is worth keeping:

Postgres cannot live on /workspace. It is a MooseFS mount that reports
every file as root:root no matter what it is chowned to, and Postgres
refuses to start unless its data directory is owned by the postgres user
-- a check with no override. So Postgres could only ever run on the pod's
LOCAL overlay filesystem, which RunPod wipes on every restart. The result
was absurd: the clinic database, the one component whose entire job is to
remember things, was the only component in the stack that could not
survive a reboot. It was lost to three separate restarts, each time
needing a reinstall and a reseed.

SQLite has no ownership model to violate -- it is one file. It sits on
/workspace and persists. For this workload the things Postgres is better
at simply do not apply: a 74-row read-mostly catalogue, one writer
process, no concurrent writers, no replication.

Journal mode is left at the default (DELETE) rather than WAL on purpose.
WAL needs a shared-memory index file alongside the database, and that is
exactly the primitive a network filesystem is least reliable at. DELETE
journalling costs write throughput this workload does not need.

DATABASE_URL still overrides everything, so pointing this back at a real
Postgres for production is a one-line environment change.
