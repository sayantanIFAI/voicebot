"""Epic E33: patient context and history -- the read model behind "the agent already
knows what I booked here", and the audit trail behind "and only tells me".

WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a health record and does not compete with one. The
hospital's systems of record (HIS for visits, LIS for tests performed and reports)
are reached through connectors that do not exist yet (KCD-131, external); until they
do, `timeline()` says so in its `sources` block instead of pretending the local
mirror is the whole picture. Nothing here stores or returns a result value, a
reading or an interpretation -- there is no column for one -- and `_assert_no_results`
refuses to emit an event that carries such a key, so a future connector cannot leak
one through this layer by accident.

WHAT IT ENFORCES.
  * every read of a patient's history is authorised (booking_service.authorize_disclosure:
    self, or a verified proxy) and AUDITED, attributed to the call that made it -- and
    every refused attempt is audited too (KCD-495);
  * before verification the only thing this service will say about a number is that a
    record EXISTS: identify() returns a status and a count, never a name (KCD-494/495);
  * ambiguity is never resolved by taking the most likely candidate: a shared number,
    or a name that fits two patients, comes back as "ambiguous" for the caller to
    settle (KCD-494/497);
  * every field of every event carries its source and the time it was read
    (KCD-493): the caller of this service can always say where a fact came from and
    how old it is, or say that it cannot see it (KCD-500).

The authorisation here is phone-based, exactly as strong as the booking lookups it
mirrors: until real caller ID reaches this API, "the number the caller said" is what
is checked. The voice agent adds its own gate in front (agent/identity.py): nothing
personal is asked for until a verification has passed.
