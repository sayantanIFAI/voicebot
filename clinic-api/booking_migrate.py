"""In-place migration for Epic E26's booking-lifecycle columns.

Same discipline as seed.py's add_i18n_columns(): ALTER TABLE for any
column an existing `appointments` row is missing, run BEFORE the first
ORM query on that table (SQLAlchemy selects every mapped column, so an
old database fails "no such column" on even a plain count()). Brand NEW
tables (SlotLock, Patient, PatientProxy, TestBooking, SmsOutbox,
DraftBooking, DepartmentRoute) need no migration at all --
Base.metadata.create_all(engine), already called at startup, creates a
missing table but never touches an existing one, so it is safe to call
every boot alongside this.
