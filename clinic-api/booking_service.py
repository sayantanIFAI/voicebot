"""Booking-lifecycle business logic for Epic E26 (Booking, Rescheduling
and Cancellation).

Kept separate from clinic-api/main.py's route handlers so the
atomicity-critical parts -- hold_slot, confirm_booking,
reschedule_appointment -- can be unit tested directly, including under
real concurrency, without a FastAPI TestClient in the loop.

Every function takes an open `db: Session` and returns a plain dict --
same contract as clinic-api/main.py's existing endpoints -- and never
raises for a normal not-found/taken/policy-blocked outcome. Only
IntegrityError from a genuine slot race is caught here, in hold_slot;
anything else propagates, matching agent/tools_client.py's ToolCallError
convention on the caller side.

No fact in here is ever composed by an LLM: prices, charges and slot
availability come from this module's own deterministic policy constants
and the database, the same discipline agent/reply_templates.py already
applies to test prices and doctor schedules.
