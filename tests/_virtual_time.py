"""A virtual-time asyncio event loop: sleeping costs no wall-clock time and the
result cannot depend on how busy the machine is.

WHY. tests/test_filler.py raced real asyncio.sleep() calls against a wall-clock
bound (`elapsed < 0.2`). It passed alone and failed when the suite shared the
machine with heavy numpy work: a scheduling stall of a few dozen milliseconds
is enough to turn "0.15 s of sleeping" into "0.21 s of measured time". A test
that asserts on ELAPSED WALL TIME measures the machine, not the code.

HOW. This is a small discrete-event simulator. The loop's clock is a number it
owns. Whenever the loop would BLOCK waiting for the next timer, the selector
wrapper advances that number by exactly the wait and returns at once, so
`await asyncio.sleep(0.15)` completes instantly in real time and takes exactly
0.15 in loop time. Everything else -- task scheduling, ordering, cancellation --
is the stock asyncio machinery, so the code under test runs unmodified.

Consequences worth having:
  * deterministic: two timers 0.02 s apart fire in that order every time, under
    any load;
  * exact: elapsed loop time is 0.15, not "less than 0.2", so a regression that
    sums two waits (0.22) is caught by a tight bound instead of hiding inside a
    generous one;
  * fast: a test that "waits" 30 seconds takes microseconds.

Real I/O still works (the selector is consulted with a zero timeout), but a
test should not mix real sockets with virtual time.
