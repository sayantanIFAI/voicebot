"""Synthetic echo scenes for tests/test_echo_cancel.py and tests/test_barge_in.py.

speech generator, the echo path is a decaying random impulse response after a
bulk delay (the client's network + output buffering), and the near-end (the
caller) is a second synthetic voice. Ground truth is known by construction.
