"""KCD-052 (agent/barge_in.py, agent/full_duplex.py): the caller talks over the
agent and is heard within 300 ms; the agent never triggers on its own audio;
false positives on noise are measured and bounded.

SYNTHETIC scenes only (tests/_synth_echo.py, tests/_synth_noise.py). The story
asks for 200 calls; tools/echo_eval.py runs that many on demand, and on real
recordings on a pod. In the suite a smaller set keeps the run short.

SAME-VOICE scenes are the deployed condition (the agent speaks in one TTS voice
per language); the scenes where the voice changes every few seconds are the worst
case and are tested separately (the hold-off after a voice change).

Measured on same-voice scenes: callers detected within budget; no false events on
echo alone or on street, clinic and fan noise.
