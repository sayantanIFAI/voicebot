"""KCD-054: agent/speaker_change.py, on a SYNTHETIC population (tests/_synth_voices.py).

Five speakers who differ in pitch and vocal-tract length, each saying phrases that
differ in content (formant movement, intonation), at different levels and noise.

What is shown: the detector separates speakers who differ the way these do, stays
quiet across changes of content, level and noise for the SAME speaker, abstains on a
turn with too little voiced speech, and its false-change rate on single-speaker calls
is measured and bounded.

What is NOT shown: how it behaves on two real siblings, on a caller with a cold, or
over a real telephone channel. The two synthetic men who sound most alike (105 vs
120 Hz, tract length 1.00 vs 0.97) are the one pair it misses on a single turn --
which is the honest limit, not a bug to hide. Thresholds are REASONED.
