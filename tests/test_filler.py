"""KCD-461: agent/filler.py's race logic, run on VIRTUAL TIME
(tests/_virtual_time.py): the sleeps below cost no wall-clock time and the
outcome cannot depend on machine load. The last test used to assert
`elapsed < 0.2` on the wall clock and failed whenever the suite shared the
machine with heavy work; the same race between a 0.02 s lookup and a 0.1 s
threshold was exposed to the same stalls. The intent of every test is unchanged
-- only the clock is.
