"""Unit tests for agent/lid.py's ASRLanguageRouter -- the orchestration
half of LID-before-ASR, which needs no model, no audio and no pod. Runs
anywhere with plain pytest:

    python -m pytest tests/test_lid.py -v

(from the repository root; unlike tests/test_smoke.py this has no
/workspace path dependency and no live services to reach.)
