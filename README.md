# Kolkata Care Diagnostics -- Voice Agent (Web Prototype)

Bengali phone-style voice agent: test rates, doctor availability, and
appointment booking, spoken over a browser WebSocket. Callers never touch
telephony or a VPN -- this is a bench prototype reachable from a RunPod
HTTP proxy URL in any browser.

This is a companion service to **voice-to-rx-repo** on the same account,
not a replacement or a from-scratch design. It shares that project's
already-debugged IndicConformer (ASR) and Ollama/Qwen2.5 (LLM) stack
outright, and adds only what that project never needed: real-time turn
detection on a live stream, and speaking back.

---

## What changed from the original blueprint, and why

The pasted plan (vLLM + native tool-calling + MediaRecorder chunks decoded
independently) was internally reasonable but untested on this account's
actual infrastructure, and voice-to-rx-repo already has hard evidence
about what breaks. Corrections below, each backed by either a web check or
this account's own deployed code.

| # | Blueprint said | Changed to | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | vLLM serving Qwen2.5-7B fp16 at `--gpu-memory-utilization 0.55` | **Ollama, `qwen2.5:7b` (Q4_K_M GGUF, 4.68GB)** -- already running on the account's pod | fp16 Qwen2.5-7B needs **~17GB VRAM** ([spheron.network measurement](https://www.spheron.network/tools/gpu-recommender/Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct/)) -- more than the stated 0.55×24GB=13.2GB budget, *before* IndicConformer and TTS get a share of the same card. The Q4 GGUF already deployed sidesteps this entirely and is proven working. |
| 2 | Native tool-calling via `--enable-auto-tool-choice --tool-call-parser hermes` | **JSON-mode + strict schema + code-side dispatch** (`agent/llm.py`, `agent/reply_templates.py`) | The flags themselves are correct for Qwen2.5 on vLLM ([vLLM docs](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/features/tool_calling/)) but unproven on this stack. voicerx/extract.py already hardened the JSON-mode pattern against a **reproduced hallucination** (a loose prompt turned a garbled fragment into "Naloxone", a real wrong drug). The model here is never allowed to state a price or confirmation number itself -- see `reply_templates.py`'s docstring. |
| 3 | "Send audio to IndicConformer" (unspecified integration) | **Reuse `voicerx.asr.ASRNode` directly**, via `PYTHONPATH` | Mainline NeMo cannot load this checkpoint at all (`KeyError: 'dir'`), and RNNT's default decode strategy silently returns empty text on real audio. Both fixes are already in `voicerx/asr.py`. Reimplementing risks reintroducing either bug from scratch. |
| 4 | MediaRecorder chunks sent and implicitly decoded per-chunk | **Chunks appended to one growing buffer, whole buffer re-decoded via ffmpeg each poll** (`main.py:_decode_to_wav`) | Confirmed against this account's own `server.py`: "MediaRecorder only puts the container header in the FIRST chunk... running ffmpeg on chunk 2 alone fails." This is a real, already-hit bug, not a hypothetical. |
| 5 | Silero VAD, unspecified mode | **Re-run `get_speech_timestamps()` per turn, not per file** (`agent/vad_stream.py`) | This account's `server.py` already hit and fixed the adjacent bug: re-running VAD over a whole growing file "orphaned any segment straddling the processed boundary... a real 3-minute recording yielded 2 segments instead of 37." Resetting the buffer after every completed turn sidesteps that class of bug rather than re-deriving the fix. |
| 6 | 2 tools (`get_doctor_availability`, `get_test_rate`) | **3 tools** -- added `book_appointment` | Section 1 of the original brief lists "Appointment Booking: validating slots and logging records into PostgreSQL" as a core capability, but no tool implemented it. Added with the fields that capability implies (doctor, date, slot, patient, phone). |
| 7 | RunPod HTTP proxy assumed to just work for WebSocket | Confirmed, with a caveat | RunPod's proxy does support WS via the `/ws` path on the HTTP proxy URL; if long-idle connections get dropped in practice, the fallback is TCP port exposure instead (`docs.runpod.io/pods/configuration/expose-ports`). Build the reconnect path either way -- don't assume the happy case. |
| 8 | (not addressed) | **Flagged: NeMo currently fails to import on the live pod** | `voice-to-rx-repo/HANDOFF.md` records this as a known, unresolved issue ("No module named 'nemo'", `PYTHONPATH` not persisting across restarts). This new service depends on the identical import. **Fix that first** -- `setup_addon.sh` checks for it and refuses to proceed silently past it. |

## The clinic data service (`clinic-api/`)

Implements the exact 3-endpoint contract `agent/tools_client.py` expects,
in **FastAPI + PostgreSQL** rather than the Java/Spring Boot originally
sketched -- same REST contract, no JVM/Maven toolchain to add to an
otherwise all-Python pod. Swap it for the real hospital backend later
without touching `main.py` or `agent/tools_client.py` at all; only this
service's queries would change.

Seeded with fictional dummy data for bench testing: **8 departments, 32
doctors (4 each), a rotating weekly chamber schedule per doctor, and 34
lab tests with realistic Kolkata pricing.** See `clinic-api/seed.py` for
the exact data.

```bash
cd clinic-api
bash setup_db.sh          # installs Postgres, creates db/user, seeds data
python3 -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

**A real bug caught in local testing, not hypothetical:** the first version
matched a caller's doctor name against the *full* formatted name ("Dr. A.
Sen"), and a query for a doctor who doesn't exist ("Doctor Nobody")
fuzzy-matched to "Dr. N. Roy" at a *higher* similarity score than a
legitimately garbled real name would score against its own doctor. That is
this system's own miniature version of the "Naloxone" bug from
voice-to-rx-repo's README -- confidently answering with the wrong doctor's
real schedule instead of saying "not found". Fixed by matching against the
surname only (`main.py:_find_doctor`, `FUZZY_SURNAME_FLOOR = 0.60`) and
verified with a local SQLite-backed test suite before this was written up.
That threshold is reasoned from a handful of test pairs, not measured
against real call audio -- treat it with the same "LOW confidence, needs
real samples" caution `gate.py`'s own floors are labelled with.

**Update: a near-match is now only a suggestion.** After an external review, a fuzzy or sound-alike match
never resolves a doctor or a test: `_find_doctor` / `_find_test` resolve only on a written-form match
(a whole name token beats a substring; several matches are "ambiguous", not the first row). The near-match
comes back as `did_you_mean` (in Bengali and Hindi script too) with `needs_confirmation`, the agent asks
"did you mean ...?", and a "yes" runs the lookup with that name.

### Patients, security questions and history (`clinic-api/registry.py`, `patient_context.py`)

Tables: `patient_registry` (id on the card, date of birth, address, name aliases), `medicines` and
`patient_medicines`, `test_performances` (with `retest_intervals`), `patient_history` (what each call did,
written when the call closes), `patient_call_cache` (the last call, kept ONE day, used as context by the
next), `verification_sessions`, `agent_messages` (operator-editable wording) and `audit_log`.

A caller is verified when the SERVER matches two of the facts they give (patient id, date of birth, full
name, address), one of them strong (id or date of birth); history is refused until then. Three failed
evaluations lock the check for the call, six failures in 24 hours lock the patient. Sample patients
(invented) are seeded on an empty registry; set `CLINIC_SEED_SAMPLE_PATIENTS=0` for a real database.
`python tools/demo_patient_history.py` shows it all working.

New settings (all with safe defaults): `ACK_MODE` (always), `SECURITY_QUESTIONS` (on), `ADAPTIVE_PAUSE` (on),
`NEAR_END_ATTENTION` (on), `CLINIC_API_TOKEN`, `CLINIC_API_REQUIRE_TOKEN`, `INTERNAL_BIND_HOST`,
`ONLY_PCM`, `CLINIC_SEED_SAMPLE_PATIENTS`, `TTS_SPEAKER`; and the earlier `AEC_BARGE_IN`,
`SEMANTIC_ENDPOINTING`, `CONDITION_INPUT` (all off).

## What's genuinely new here (no precedent to lean on)

- **Real-time turn detection** (`agent/vad_stream.py`). voicerx's VAD is
  built for an already-finished recording; this polls a live, growing
  buffer instead. Bench-test this against real pauses/fillers before
  trusting the 0.8s silence threshold -- it is a reasonable default, not a
  measured one (contrast with, e.g., `gate.py`'s thresholds, which *are*
  measured against real audio and say so).
- **TTS** (`agent/tts.py`). voicerx never speaks. AI4Bharat's
  [Indic-TTS](https://github.com/AI4Bharat/Indic-TTS) (FastPitch +
  HiFi-GAN, Bengali checkpoint on Bhashini) is confirmed real, but nothing
  in this account has deployed it before -- treat it with the same
  suspicion the rest of this stack earned before it was trusted.
- **The Spring Boot contract** (`agent/tools_client.py`). Nothing in this
  account currently implements `/api/v1/tests/search`,
  `/api/v1/doctors/availability`, or `/api/v1/appointments`. The docstrings
  in that file are the spec to hand to whoever builds it.

## Architecture

```
Browser (MediaRecorder, same capture settings as voicerx's UI)
   │  binary WS frames, ~250ms webm/opus chunks
   ▼
FastAPI /ws/audio  (main.py)
   │
   ├─ growing-buffer ffmpeg decode, every 0.5s   (proven pattern, #4 above)
   ├─ TurnDetector.poll()                         (agent/vad_stream.py)
   │     "has the caller stopped talking?"
   ▼  (on yes)
TurnASR.transcribe_utterance()                    (agent/asr.py -> voicerx.asr.ASRNode)
   ▼
extract_intent()                                  (agent/llm.py -> Ollama, qwen2.5:7b)
   ▼  {intent, slots}
ClinicToolsClient.*()                              (agent/tools_client.py -> Spring Boot)
   ▼  real data
reply_templates.*()                                 -- text ASSEMBLED from the API response
   ▼
TTSClient.synthesize()                             (agent/tts.py -> Indic-TTS)
   ▼  WAV bytes, or a pre-recorded fallback on any failure above
binary WS frame back to the browser
```

## Deployment

On the **same RunPod pod** as voice-to-rx-repo (shares its GPU, its NeMo
install, its Ollama instance):

```bash
git clone <this repo> /workspace/kolkata-care-voice-agent
cd /workspace/kolkata-care-voice-agent
bash setup_addon.sh 2>&1 | tee /workspace/setup_addon.log
```

Then, per the script's final instructions, export `PYTHONPATH`,
`CLINIC_API_BASE`, `TTS_URL`, and start uvicorn on **port 8100** --
voice-to-rx-repo already owns 8000 on this pod. Expose 8100 separately in
the RunPod console.

**Running two GPU services on one pod means IndicConformer is loaded into
VRAM twice** (~1.2GB each, per `HANDOFF.md`'s measured figure) -- once by
voice-to-rx-repo's `server.py`, once by this service. On a 24GB card
that's still comfortable alongside Ollama's 4.68GB and TTS's footprint,
but if that stops being true, the fix is merging both FastAPI apps into
one process sharing one `ASRNode` singleton -- not a day-one requirement
for a prototype, but flag it before scaling call volume.

## Error handling

Every stage fails into a distinct, spoken response -- a caller never gets
dead air. See `main.py:_dispatch_turn` and `agent/tts.py`'s fallback set.

| Failure | Caller hears | Why this response specifically |
|---|---|---|
| ASR returns empty text | "দুঃখিত, শুনতে পাইনি, আবার বলুন" | Distinct from "didn't understand" -- nothing was transcribed at all, most likely silence/noise, not a real question. |
| LLM extraction fails validation after retries | "একটু সমস্যা হচ্ছে, একটু ধরুন" | Never surfaces a malformed/partial answer -- silence-then-apology beats a wrong price. |
| Spring Boot call times out / errors | "এখনই দেখতে পারছি না, স্টাফের কাছে দিচ্ছি" | Deliberately different wording from "not found" (a valid, informative answer) -- an infra failure should not read to the caller as "no such test exists". |
| TTS service itself is down | Same apology text, spoken from a **pre-recorded** file, not synthesized live | If TTS is what's broken, asking it to say so is circular. `tts.py`'s fallback set must be recorded once, ahead of time, and never regenerated live. |
| Caller doesn't give a required slot (e.g. no doctor name) | A specific clarifying question per missing field (`reply_templates.missing_slot_prompt`) | Never calls the Spring Boot API with a null/guessed field. |
| One caller's WS connection throws | Logged, socket closed, temp files cleaned up | A bug in one call must not take down the process for every other line. |

## Known limitations (stated plainly, not hidden)

1. **No barge-in.** While the agent is speaking, the caller's audio is
   still being captured and will be dispatched as the *next* turn once
   they stop -- the caller cannot interrupt mid-reply. Acceptable for a
   prototype; a real deployment should stop TTS playback if new speech is
   detected.
2. **Silero's 0.8s silence threshold is a default, not a measured
   value** -- unlike `gate.py`'s thresholds elsewhere in this account,
   which are calibrated against real samples with stated confidence.
   Budget a bench session with real Bengali speakers before trusting it.
3. **MediaRecorder + `audio/webm` does not work on Safari/iOS at all.**
   The bench client detects this and disables the button rather than
   failing silently, but a real phone-browser deployment reaching iOS
   users needs a different capture path.
4. **TTS is entirely unproven on this account.** Everything else in this
   README leans on code that has already run against real audio; the TTS
   integration has not. Do not treat it as equally trustworthy until it
   has been.
5. **The Spring Boot service does not exist yet.** `tools_client.py`
   documents the contract; nothing here builds that service.
