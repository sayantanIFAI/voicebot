// whose header exists only in the first chunk of a session, which forces
// the server to re-decode the entire call from byte 0 on every poll --
// O(T^2) per call, plus an ffmpeg process spawn every 500ms. Raw PCM has
// no container, so the server appends and slices instead of decoding.
//
// Runs on the audio render thread, so it must stay allocation-light:
// one reusable buffer, and a copy handed off only when a block is full.
