"""KCD-054: notice when a different person takes the phone after verification.

A patient verified themselves; then the handset is passed to someone else in the
household. Without a speaker signal the agent goes on disclosing to whoever is
now speaking. This module computes, per turn, HOW DIFFERENT the voice is from the
voice that was verified, and a decision the identity layer (agent/identity.py)
acts on: a change re-triggers verification before any further disclosure.

WHAT THE SIGNAL IS. Two cheap, numpy-only cues that survive a telephone channel
and need no trained model: the long-term average spectrum of the voiced frames
(vocal-tract length and timbre) with level removed, and the median pitch. They
are compared across turns of the SAME call, so the channel is constant and
cancels. A distance combines them.

WHAT IT IS NOT. It is not speaker verification and must never be used to
AUTHENTICATE anyone: it cannot say that this voice is the patient, only that this
voice differs from the one that was verified minutes ago. Family members can
sound alike; a sick or tired caller can sound unlike themselves. The two
failure directions are not symmetrical, and the policy reflects that: a MISSED
change means disclosure continues (mitigated by every disclosure being
gated on verification in the first place -- this is a second lock, not the only
one), a FALSE change costs the genuine caller one extra verification question.
So the threshold is set to keep false changes on single-speaker calls rare and
bounded, and the detector abstains ("insufficient") on a turn with too little
voiced speech rather than guess.

Thresholds are REASONED, chosen from a sweep on SYNTHETIC voices (tests/test_speaker_change.py,
tests/_synth_voices.py) whose speakers differ in pitch and vocal-tract length and
whose phrases differ in content. Recalibrate on recorded multi-speaker calls
(KCD-203 and the recording programme) before trusting the numbers on real callers.
