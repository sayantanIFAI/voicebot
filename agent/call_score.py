"""The "implicit happiness" score: how well did this call go for the caller, judged from what the bot already sees, for
EVERY call, without asking anyone anything.

Asking every caller to rate the call reaches a small share of them (a few percent by post-call SMS, more inside the call)
and only the ones who choose to answer. The bot, however, sees the shape of every call: whether it had to ask again,
whether it was slow, whether the caller swore, asked for a person, talked over it, or went quiet, and whether the thing
they called about actually got done. This module turns those counts into one 0-100 number and says WHY, so a low
score can be traced to a cause and a good one is not a mystery.

What this is NOT: a measure of what the caller FELT. It is a proxy built from behaviour, and it says so
(`SCORE_MODEL_VERSION`, `basis: "behaviour"`). Every weight below is REASONED, not measured: they are the right
order of magnitude and the right sign, and nothing more. The way to make them real is to compare the score with the
caller's own answer on the calls where one is asked (the planned one-question survey) and refit; until then, read the
score as a ranking of calls (this one went worse than that one), not as a percentage of happy callers.

Pure and deterministic: the same signals always give the same score, in the same order of reasons. No text of any
conversation goes in or comes out -- only counts and flags -- so the score can be stored with the call record without
adding anything personal to it.
