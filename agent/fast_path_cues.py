"""Per-language cue tables for the deterministic fast path (KCD-095, KCD-094).

The fast path decides "is this a price question, a doctor-availability question, a test-preparation question, a
clinic FAQ, a greeting" from CUE words before it looks for the entity (which test, which doctor). Those cues used to
be Bengali literals inline in agent/fast_path.py, so a Hindi or English caller was never served by it: speed was a
Bengali-only privilege. They are now DATA, one `CueTable` per language behind one interface:

    register(CueTable(lang="ta", ...))      # adding a language is data, not code

`FastPath.resolve(text, lang)` picks the table for `lang`. A language with no table -- including "unknown", the
language-identification result for an utterance that is none of the supported languages -- is not guessed at: the
fast path abstains and the turn goes to the model (Blueprint 4.4), so a Bengali cue table can never fire on a
Hindi sentence.

REASONED, NOT MEASURED. The Bengali table is the pre-existing one, unchanged. The Hindi and English tables were
written from the same intent categories by a non-native reviewer; they are deliberately conservative (a cue that is
ambiguous in that language -- Hindi "kal" means both tomorrow and yesterday -- is treated as "I am not sure" and the
turn abstains). The serve-rate gap between languages is REPORTED (`FastPath.snapshot()["language_gap"]`) and a gap
wider than LANGUAGE_GAP_MARGIN is a defect to fix in this data, not to accept. Recalibrate against real call
transcripts, and have a native speaker of each language review the cues, before trusting either.
