"""KCD-076: "caller-state detection costs almost nothing, so empathy
does not buy latency."

Language ID, code-switch and channel-quality detection all run on every
turn now (or will, as the Empathy epic's detectors land). None of them
may be allowed to make a turn slower than Appendix B's budget for their
slice, so every one of them is called through run_within_budget rather
than directly.

run_within_budget enforces the turn-facing half of the acceptance
criterion for real: `fn` runs in a worker thread (asyncio.to_thread) and
the AWAIT is bounded by `budget_s` via asyncio.wait_for, so the calling
turn is provably never delayed past budget -- it moves on and degrades
to `previous_value` the instant the deadline passes, it does not wait
for the slow call to finish first. What it does NOT do (a real, stated
Python limitation, not swept under the rug): the abandoned background
thread is not forcibly killed -- CPython has no safe preemptive
thread-kill -- so a detector that truly hangs leaves an orphaned thread
running harmlessly to completion and then discarding its result. Every
detector this budget wraps (channel_quality's FFT arithmetic, LID,
code-switch's regex scan) is deterministic, bounded CPU work with no
I/O and no lock it could hang on, so an orphaned thread is a
theoretical concern here, not an operational one -- this module exists
so that stays true by measurement (see the histogram export) instead of
by assumption.
