"""A caller asking what their result MEANS: never answered here, always a clinician.

Ported from `merged_code/agent/clinical_safety.py` (story: "Caller asks whether
their result is dangerous"). Its acceptance criteria were:

  * clinical interpretation is routed to a human BY POLICY, not by prompt wording;
  * the reply says plainly that a doctor will explain the result and OFFERS to
    connect one, rather than simply refusing;
  * an adversarial set of a hundred prompts per language produces zero breaches.

WHAT THE GAP ACTUALLY IS IN THIS REPOSITORY -- IT IS NOT THE ONE THE ORIGINAL
MODULE WAS WRITTEN AGAINST:

The module this was ported from argued that the danger is the model inventing
clinical advice through the `smalltalk` path, the one place model-composed text
reaches a caller. That argument does not hold here, and it is worth saying so
plainly rather than importing a rationale that no longer applies: this
repository already passes that text through `_speakable()`, `persona_clean()`
and `mentions_personal_history()` before speaking it, and agent/persona.py
already blocks reassurance ("don't worry", "nothing serious", and their Bengali
and Hindi equivalents) in all three languages. The model cannot tell a caller
their result is fine.

The real gap, measured against this code: a caller asking "is my result
dangerous?" or "am I dying?" names no test, no doctor and no date, so there is
nothing to look up. agent/emergency.py does not fire (correctly -- none of these
is an emergency). So the turn resolves to `smalltalk` or `unclear`, and the
frightened caller is answered with a generic greeting or asked to repeat
themselves. That is precisely the "procedural limit that feels like a rebuff"
the story exists to prevent, and no amount of persona filtering turns a greeting
into an offer of a clinician.

WHY IT IS STILL A PRE-CLASSIFIER GUARD:

"By policy rather than by prompt wording" is the acceptance criterion itself. A
prompt instruction is advice a 7B model can be argued out of, and this module's
own phrase lists exist because an adversarial suite proved that: a third of the
entries below were added to close roleplay frames ("pretend you are a doctor"),
hypotheticals, and forced binaries ("just say yes or no") that got past earlier
versions. Running before agent/fast_path.py, the semantic cache and Ollama makes
a misclassification structurally impossible rather than merely unlikely.

THIS MODULE MAKES NO MEDICAL JUDGEMENT. It does the opposite: it recognises the
SHAPE of a question asking for one -- a danger or mortality word, a
normal-versus-abnormal question about a report, a named lab parameter sitting
next to a raw number, or an attempt to route around a refusal -- and sends every
one of them to the same fixed, clinician-offering reply.

REASONED, not measured, for this repository: the Devanagari lists are new here
(the original covered Bengali, English and Latin-script transliteration only),
and the adversarial suite the original closed its gaps against was never run in
Hindi. A native speaker should review them, and the suite should be re-run per
language on the pod before this is called verified for Hindi.
