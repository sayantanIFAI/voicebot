"""A caller who changes the subject mid-booking keeps the booking (KCD-104).

THE PROBLEM. Cross-turn slot memory and corrections already existed (agent/booking_flow.py: a later value
overwrites an earlier one, `correction_acknowledgement` says what changed). What did not exist:

  * A question asked in the middle of a booking ("what does the CBC cost?") was answered, but nothing brought the
    caller back, so the booking quietly stalled.
  * At the last step, "shall I confirm this?", EVERY reply was treated as yes or no. A question, or a correction
    ("make it 11 o'clock"), was answered by reading the confirmation out again: never understood, never answered.
  * Starting a DIFFERENT task (say, cancelling another appointment) while one was half-collected replaced the
    booking state, and the caller's captured details were gone.

WHAT THIS MODULE IS. The pure decisions, with no model, network or audio in them:

    classify(booking, intent)     what this turn is, relative to the task in progress
    worth_suspending(booking)     is there anything a caller would be annoyed to lose
    resume_line / confirm_resume_line / offer_resume   what the agent says to bring the caller back

and the wording, in Bengali, Hindi and English. The orchestrator (main.py) does the I/O: it answers the question,
keeps or suspends the state, and speaks the resume line. The resume line is a question ("...Shall I confirm it?" or
the next missing detail), so it is skipped when the reply it would follow already asks one, and when the caller-state
policy allows no question at all.

DECIDED, NOT GUESSED. Whether a turn is a topic change is decided from the intent the extractor returned, which is
already validated against the closed intent set (agent/llm.py); this module never reads the words. A yes or a no is
still decided by agent/booking_flow.classify_yes_no, deterministically, and anything else at the confirmation step
is treated as a fresh turn rather than a guess at yes or no.
