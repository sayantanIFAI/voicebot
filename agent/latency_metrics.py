"""KCD-469: "time to first audio and turn latency are reported per
language and per mixture bucket... a gap beyond a stated margin is a
defect with an owner rather than a characteristic of the segment."

agent/admission.py already tracks turn latency, but only in aggregate
(its own p50/p95 feed latency_shed, a single process-wide signal by
design -- see that module's docstring). This is the PER-LANGUAGE
breakdown that aggregate cannot show: whether Hindi/English turns are
systematically slower than Bengali's, not just whether the process as a
whole is currently over budget.
