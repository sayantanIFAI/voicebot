"""Ask again, kindly, before routing to a human.

A caller who is faint, mumbling, in a noisy room, or talking over someone
else is not asking to be transferred -- they are asking to be heard. Today
a turn the system cannot use either gets one flat "please repeat" or (for
an ambiguous language) an immediate hand-off. This module owns the
decision instead:

    proceed   the turn is usable -- reset the failure count, carry on.
    reask     say WHY, in the caller's language and without blaming them
              (phrases reask_*), and listen again.
    handoff   after `max_reasks` consecutive failures, apologise
              (reask_final) and route to a person.

It only acts when the turn actually FAILED (empty ASR, a jumbled
transcript, an unidentifiable language). Acoustic trouble alone -- mild
noise the recogniser coped with -- never triggers a re-ask: nagging a
caller whose words were understood is its own kind of failure. When the
turn did fail, the acoustic assessment (agent/audio_quality.py) decides
WHICH kind of re-ask is most useful ("speak up" is no help to someone in a
noisy room).

A second consecutive failure marks the caller as "confused" -- Appendix C's
"confusion / speech difficulty" row -- which slows the agent, shortens its
sentences and lowers its escalation threshold for the rest of the call
(agent/speech_policy.py). That is the deterministic empathy Blueprint 4.5
asks for, driven by a rule, not by asking a model to be kind.
