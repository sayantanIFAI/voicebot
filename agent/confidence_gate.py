"""KCD-442/KCD-447: what a low-ASR-confidence turn is allowed to do.

agent/asr.py already computes `ASRResult.decoder_agreement` (CTC vs RNNT
agreement, 0.0-1.0) but nothing downstream ever reads it once language
routing is done -- exactly the gap both stories point at (see their Repo
Evidence). This module is the one place that decides what "low
confidence" means and what it implies, so main.py's dispatch consults a
single flag instead of re-deriving the threshold at each call site.

Two distinct consequences, matching the two stories:
  - KCD-442: a low-confidence turn asking a FACTUAL question (test_rate,
    doctor_availability, test_prep, clinic_faq) does not run the lookup
    at all -- a misheard entity name silently returning a confident,
    wrong answer for a DIFFERENT test/doctor is exactly the kind of
    quietly-wrong fact CLAUDE.md's truth boundary exists to prevent.
    agent/reply_templates.py's insufficient_information_reply() is
    spoken instead, distinct from "not found" (KCD-443, already Done)
    and from an infrastructure apology.
  - KCD-447: a low-confidence turn is never enough on its own to commit a
    WRITE (a booking hold/confirm/cancel/reschedule). Booking actions in
    this codebase already never write without passing through
    booking_flow.mark_confirming + an explicit classify_yes_no "yes" on
    a LATER turn (pinned locally by tests/test_booking_flow.py's KCD-484
    tests -- the state machine never reaches a write stage on its own and
    classify_yes_no never reads an uncertain answer as yes; the commit
    itself lives in main.py and is verified on-pod only); this module's role for
    writes is only to make that guarantee explicit and testable, not to
    add a second gate on top of it.

THRESHOLD is REASONED, not measured -- there is no real-call corpus
locally to calibrate the boundary between "ASR was genuinely unsure" and
"ASR was fine", the same "measured vs reasoned" caveat fast_path.py's
FAQ_COMMIT_FLOOR already carries. Recalibrate against real call audio
before trusting this past the pilot.
