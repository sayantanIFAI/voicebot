"""KCD-159: mixed-script synthesis with an explicit pronunciation path.

The Indic FastPitch tokenizers DROP any character outside their own
script (agent/bn_normalize.py documents the measurement): a Latin word
inside a Bengali or Hindi reply is not mispronounced, it is silently
absent, and the caller hears a sentence with a hole in it. Until now the
only remedy was a seven-entry table, and everything else was blocked by
agent/tts.py (KCD-455) -- correct, but it means "Your report is pending"
type sentences can never be spoken at all.

This module is the explicit path: an English word (or acronym) inside a
Bengali/Hindi reply is rendered through a curated LEXICON of how a
speaker of that language actually says it -- "সুগার", not the Latin
letters. It is deliberately NOT a general transliterator. A guessed
pronunciation of a medical term is worse than a blocked reply: a
mispronounced drug or test name is a wrong fact in the caller's ear, the
same class of failure CLAUDE.md's truth boundary exists to prevent. So:

  1. a word in the lexicon is spoken the way the lexicon says;
  2. an ALL-CAPS acronym (CBC, MRI, PSA) not in the lexicon is spelled
     letter by letter -- how a person reads an unknown acronym, and safe;
  3. anything else stays in Latin script, is reported by
     unspeakable_spans(), and blocks the reply (KCD-455) exactly as before.

SIGN-OFF IS NOT DONE, AND THIS MODULE SAYS SO
---------------------------------------------
The story requires the two hundred most frequent English clinical terms
to be signed off by a native listener per language. That listening review
cannot be performed by this codebase. What is here: LEXICON_TARGET = 200,
the entries below (every one marked unreviewed), coverage() to report the
gap honestly, and review_sheet() to export exactly what a native listener
needs to tick off. The spellings below are a good-faith first pass by a
non-native speaker: treat every one as a draft.
