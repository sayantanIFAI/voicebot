"""Bengali/Hindi/English TTS via AI4Bharat's FastPitch + HiFi-GAN (Indic-TTS).

One tts_server.py process serves all three languages (bn/hi/en); this client
picks the voice per call with `lang` and verbalizes per language
(agent/speech_norm.py). Everything below written about Bengali holds for the
other two: their tokenizers drop out-of-script characters the same way.


Confirmed real and Bengali-capable: github.com/AI4Bharat/Indic-TTS ships
monolingual FastPitch+HiFi-GAN-V1 checkpoints for 13 Indian languages
including Bengali, hosted on the Bhashini platform, with a `synthesize`
inference module. Run its own server process (see README.md "Deploying
Indic-TTS") and point TTS_URL at it -- this client does not embed the
model itself, the same way tools_client.py does not embed the clinic DB.

This is the one piece of the pipeline with NO precedent in voice-to-rx-repo
-- that system never talks back, so nothing here has been battle-tested on
this account the way ASR/LLM have. Treat the fallback path below as load-
bearing, not decorative: a diagnostics line that goes silent when TTS is
down is worse than one that plays a stiff canned apology.

Two things happen here before a single byte is synthesized:

1. bn_normalize.verbalize() spells every number into Bengali words. This
   is not optional polish -- the tokenizer drops Latin digits outright, so
   without it every price is silence. See that module's docstring for the
   measurement.
2. An exact-text WAV cache. Synthesis is a pure function of the text, and
   reply_templates.py deliberately produces a SMALL set of sentences, so
   the hit rate on greetings, apologies and repeat questions is high. This
   is the cheapest latency win in the whole pipeline.
