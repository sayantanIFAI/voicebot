"""Find which spoken form appears in an utterance, without scoring every form against every stretch of it (KCD-096).

THE PROBLEM. `agent/fast_path.py` decides "which test / which doctor / which FAQ topic did the caller name" by sliding
a window of a few words along the utterance and taking the best `difflib` similarity against every known spoken
form. That is (forms x windows) `SequenceMatcher` runs per turn. Measured on the 74-row seeded catalogue it took
17-156 ms per turn -- against a 150 ms budget for the whole fast tier -- and about 3-5 seconds at 5,000 rows.

TWO CHANGES, KEPT APART BECAUSE ONE IS EXACT AND ONE IS NOT.

1. Exact pruning (always on when a floor is given). `difflib.SequenceMatcher.ratio()` can never exceed
   2 * (letters the two strings have in common, counted with multiplicity) / (len(a) + len(b)). That is a proven
   upper bound. If the bound is already below the commit floor, the real ratio is too, so the pair cannot be a
   commit and its full comparison is skipped. Every result AT OR ABOVE the floor is bit-for-bit what the full scan
   returns. On the seeded catalogue this leaves about 7 of 2,255 comparisons.

2. A bigram shortlist (only for large tables, `index_min_forms`). Forms sharing too few character pairs with the
   utterance are not compared at all. This one is NOT exact: a form whose only match is scattered, non-adjacent
   letters can be dropped. The failure direction is safe by construction -- the caller of this module commits only
   above a floor that is computed on the very same ratio, so a dropped form can only turn a would-be fast answer into
   "abstain, ask the model". It can never make a wrong answer. Short forms (< SHORT_FORM_CHARS) are never dropped:
   one changed letter of four still scores 0.75, and they are few. The parity test in
   tests/test_form_index.py measures how often the shortlist changes a decision on generated utterances.

What this module does NOT do is fold to phonemes. A fast-path COMMIT is answered with no model behind it, and a
sound-alike is exactly the "Doctor Nobody" evidence CLAUDE.md forbids acting on; sound-alikes are for suggestions
that a caller then confirms (agent/gazetteer.py). The commit gate here stays a character similarity.
