"""KCD-353: the patient-facing disclosure that the agent is automated.

A patient has the right to know they are speaking to an automated system, so that
they can decide how to use it. The disclosure is:

  * SPOKEN at the start of every call -- inside the greeting, in the language the
    call opens in (Bengali), and AGAIN, once, in the caller's own language the
    first time they answer in a different one (Hindi or English);
  * STATED on every text channel: every outbound message the clinic-api queues
    carries the notice in clinic-api/disclosure.py (kept in step with this file's
    version by tests/test_disclosure_and_human_request.py);
  * FOLLOWED by an honoured request for a person: agent/human_request.py catches
    "let me talk to someone" before any model is consulted and hands the call over.

The wording is VERSIONED and PENDING REVIEW. The story requires the clinical and
legal leads to review it; that is not something this codebase can do, and the
words below were drafted by the engineering side. REVIEW_STATUS says so and the
release gate reads it. Changing a word means bumping DISCLOSURE_VERSION, so an
audit can say which wording a given call heard (the version is logged per call).

# What is spoken, and the built-in default: the operator can change it from the database without a
# deploy (agent/messages.py, key "disclosure"), and the call record stores which wording was heard.
# Who the caller is speaking with, that it is automated, and that a person is available -- one short
# sentence each, so the caller knows what they are talking to and that they are not stuck with it.
# Native script for the brand name in Bengali and Hindi: a Latin word inside Bengali text is dropped
# by the Bengali voice (agent/bn_normalize.py).
