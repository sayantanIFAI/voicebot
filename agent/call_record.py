"""KCD-501: every call leaves a complete record.

"Intent, actions taken, values confirmed, escalation reason and outcome are written
within thirty seconds of the call ending. The write is idempotent and a dropped call
still records what was completed."

How each part is met:

  * WRITTEN AS THE CALL GOES. Every event (a language, an intent, a completed action,
    confirmed values, an escalation) is queued the moment it happens and flushed
    right away, so a call that drops -- socket closed, process killed, network cut --
    already has everything that was completed before it dropped. The end-of-call write
    only adds the outcome.

  * IDEMPOTENT. Each event carries a sequence number that this recorder assigns ONCE
    and keeps until the server acknowledges it (clinic-api applies an event only if
    its `seq` is higher than the last applied). A retry after a lost response is
    acknowledged as a duplicate and changes nothing: no doubled action, no doubled
    intent.

  * WITHIN THIRTY SECONDS. finish() flushes with a deadline (FINISH_DEADLINE_S, 25 s),
    retrying failed events with a short backoff until it either drains or the deadline
    passes; the un-flushed count is returned and logged so a miss is visible, never
    silent.

  * MINIMAL. Values confirmed are redacted server-side (clinic-api redact_confirmed):
    an allow-list of fields, a phone as its last four digits, no name and no address.

Pure asyncio around an injected writer: tests use a fake that fails, duplicates and
drops on demand.
