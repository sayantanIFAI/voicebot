"""KCD-513: acknowledge before answering.

A caller who asks a question and gets the answer with no preamble hears a
machine reading a table. A brief acknowledgement first -- "Sure." "ঠিক আছে।"
"ठीक है।" -- shows the request was heard, and it costs nothing if it is one
spoken word. Two constraints keep it honest:

  * It CANNOT INTRODUCE A FACT. Every entry is a fixed string with no digit, no
    placeholder, no name, at most three words (validate_table() and the tests
    enforce this on every entry). The acknowledgement is chosen by this module
    from a table; a model never composes it. It says "heard", never "I will" or
    "it is" -- an acknowledgement that promised something would be a claim.

  * It is SUPPRESSED on repeat turns, so it does not become a verbal tic. It is
    not spoken on consecutive replies, not in front of an apology or another
    acknowledgement (the distress acknowledgement of agent/acknowledgement.py
    already opened that turn), not before a one-word reply, and its variant
    rotates so the same word is not heard turn after turn.

Wording is provisional and pending native review (agent/persona.py).
