"""KCD-514: apologies that are calibrated and never stacked.

A caller who hears "Sorry, I could not hear you. Sorry, sorry, please repeat." is
being made to feel that a small problem is a crisis. Two rules, both enforced:

  1. AT MOST ONE apology per spoken reply. Templates are written to that rule
     and tests/test_persona_and_apology.py fails the build if one is not; but a
     reply is sometimes ASSEMBLED at run time from two templates (a secondary
     answer appended to a primary one, an acknowledgement in front of a failure),
     so enforce_single_apology() runs on every reply just before it is spoken and
     removes the later ones. It only ever removes an apology; it never edits a fact.

  2. The WORDING says what actually went wrong, because an apology for the wrong
     thing is worse than none. Four causes, kept distinct:

        NOT_HEARD           I could not hear you well enough          (audio)
        CANNOT_CHECK        I cannot look that up right now           (a system is down)
        INSUFFICIENT_INFO   I do not have verified information on it  (nothing to say)
        NOT_EXIST           what you named is not one of ours         (a real "not found")

     "Cannot check" and "does not exist" must never be interchangeable: telling a
     caller a doctor does not exist because a service was down is a false
     statement, and the reverse sends them away from a doctor who is there. The
     mapping from the existing phrase keys to a cause is in CAUSE_OF_PHRASE_KEY.

Nothing here contains a fact, a number or a name. The wording is provisional and
pending native review (agent/persona.py REVIEW_STATUS).
