"""KCD-051: acoustic echo cancellation with the synthesised audio as the
far-end reference.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The half-duplex gate (agent/playback_gate.py) works by
deafness: the agent cannot hear anything while it speaks, so it cannot be
interrupted, and it costs a fixed guard after every reply. Browser echo
cancellation cannot help on this path -- the audio is synthesised here and
played through Web Audio, which the browser's canceller never sees as a
far-end signal. But THIS side knows exactly what it sent, so it can be the
canceller: subtract a filtered copy of the reference from the microphone and
what remains is the caller (plus noise and whatever the filter could not
model).

WHAT IS HERE (numpy only, no vendor SDK):
  * MDFCanceller -- a partitioned-block frequency-domain adaptive filter
    (overlap-save, NLMS-normalised per bin). Block 256 samples (16 ms at
    16 kHz), 8 partitions => 128 ms of echo path after alignment. About 3.5% of
    one core per call in numpy.
  * estimate_delay_long -- GCC-PHAT bulk delay between the reference as PLACED
    on the call timeline and the microphone, taking the EARLIEST strong peak
    (the direct path) rather than the tallest. The client's playback starts an
    unknown time after the server sent the clip (network + output buffer), so
    the filter is aligned by measurement, not assumed; a change of delay must
    be seen twice before it is adopted.
  * Double-talk handling. The filter must not learn from a caller talking over
    the agent. Two detectors -- a loosened Geigel test and a short-term ERLE
    COLLAPSE test against the best recent cancellation -- freeze adaptation
    (step 2% of normal). Both were needed: a first version compared against the
    running ERLE, which the caller itself dragged down, so it stopped noticing
    the caller, and the filter was wrecked (ERLE 26 dB -> 4 dB). Freezing the
    running figures while a caller talks fixed that.
  * Residual echo suppression -- attenuates only the spectral bins where the
    error is no larger than the residual the achieved ERLE predicts, so a
    caller (whose bins sit far above it) is not touched.
  * EchoPipeline -- the streaming wrapper the server uses: feed_reference()
    places far-end audio on the microphone timeline, process_ex() returns the
    cleaned microphone signal and the echo estimate, stats() reports ERLE and
    the delay.

MEASURED (tests/test_echo_cancel.py, synthetic scenes; see that file for the
scenes): steady-state ERLE 21-27 dB after about ten seconds of far-end speech;
17-24 dB with a distorting loudspeaker; delay tracked to within 25 ms for
120-400 ms; a caller talking over a converged filter comes through at 0.999
correlation and the filter is not damaged. KNOWN WEAK SPOT: when the far-end
VOICE changes the filter has never seen the newly excited frequencies and
cancellation dips to 0-7 dB for two to three seconds.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLAIM. Every number above is on SYNTHETIC echo paths. The
story asks for ERLE on REAL handsets and "never triggers a turn on its own
output over two hundred calls"; tools/echo_eval.py is the instrument for both
on a pod with recorded handset audio. A handset with strong speaker
non-linearity will cancel less than the linear model predicts; agent/barge_in.py
and agent/full_duplex.py are built not to trust the canceller before it has
measurably converged.
