"""Semantic cache for the intent-extraction step.

WHAT IS CACHED, AND WHAT DELIBERATELY IS NOT
--------------------------------------------
Cached: the transcript -> {intent, slots} extraction. That is a pure
function of the caller's words, and it is the slowest hop in the turn
(Ollama, ~1-3s warm; llm.py already had to raise its timeout to 90s for
the cold case).

NOT cached: the clinic lookup or the final reply. Those are ~5ms against
Postgres and they are the part that must never go stale -- a price that
changed, a doctor who cancelled, a slot that just got booked. Caching a
finished reply would trade the one guarantee this system is built around
(reply_templates.py: "the actual number in the caller's ear always comes
from the Spring Boot response") for a few milliseconds. Not worth it.

So a cache hit still does the live lookup. It just skips the LLM.

WHY TWO TIERS
-------------
L1 is an exact match on normalized text. Free, and always safe.

L2 is cosine similarity over bge-m3 embeddings, served by the Ollama
instance already running for Qwen -- no new venv, no new GPU process, no
new Python dependency (this module imports nothing that llm.py doesn't).
bge-m3 is genuinely multilingual, Bengali included, which matters: the
whole point is that "ইউরিক অ্যাসিড টেস্ট কত" and "ইউরিক এসিদ টেস্ট এ কত টাকা
পড়বে" are the same question with different ASR output, and a string
comparison can never see that.

THE PII RULE
------------
An L2 hit is a *fuzzy* hit -- similar, not identical. That is fine for
"which test did they ask about". It is dangerous for a phone number or a
patient name, where a near-miss means confidently reading back someone
else's details. So entries whose slots carry caller-specific data are
stored for L1 (exact) retrieval only and are never eligible for L2. See
`_is_l2_eligible`.

#   same question, reworded / ASR-garbled   0.7809 .. 0.8156

#
# Two things follow, and both matter:
#
# 1. An initial 0.90 would have hit NOTHING. Every real paraphrase sits in
#    the 0.78-0.82 band, so the cache would have reported a 0% semantic
#    hit rate forever while looking perfectly healthy.
# 2. Cosine ALONE cannot be trusted here at any threshold. The margin
#    between "same question reworded" and "different test, same phrasing"
#    is 0.03. The embedding is dominated by the sentence frame ("X
#    টেস্টের রেট কত"); the test name -- the only part that decides which
#    price the caller is quoted -- is a small share of the signal. A
#    threshold tuned to fire on real paraphrases will also fire across
#    different tests, and the failure mode is quoting a confident wrong
#    price. That is precisely the class of bug reply_templates.py exists
#    to prevent, so it does not get reintroduced here.
#
# Hence: threshold set where paraphrases actually land, AND every hit
# carrying an entity slot must clear _entity_guard() below.

# Slots naming a THING whose identity decides which record gets looked up.
# A semantic hit may not cross one of these without character-level proof.

# fuzzy-similar question ("কোথায় গাড়ি রাখব" vs "ক্লিনিকটা কোথায়") must not
# let a cached "parking" answer get served for a "location" question just
# because the sentence shapes are close in embedding space.

# Bengali-vs-Bengali character similarity, so ASR garble ("ইউরিক এসিদ" vs
# "ইউরিক অ্যাসিড") still matches while a genuinely different test does not.
# Both sides are always the same script here, which is what makes this
# work -- the cross-script version of this comparison is the one that can
# never succeed (see clinic-api's aliases_bn).
#
# Measured against entity "ইউরিক অ্যাসিড" on the live pod:
#
#   same test, ASR-garbled / reworded   0.696 .. 1.000
#   different test entirely             0.231 .. 0.381
#     (থাইরয়েড, ভিটামিন ডি, সুগার, লিপিড প্রোফাইল, ক্রিয়েটিনিন)
#
# 0.55 sits in the middle of that gap. Note how much wider this separation
# is (0.315) than the cosine one (0.03) on the SAME distinction: character
# overlap identifies WHICH test far more sharply than sentence embeddings
# do, which is exactly why the entity check is the authority here and
# cosine is only the recall filter that precedes it.

# A floor of 0.70 was tried first and rejected 0.696 -- a real ASR variant
# of the right test -- by four thousandths. Tune from measurements, not
