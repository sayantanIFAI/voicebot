"""KCD-084: recognise an older caller from how they sound (and what they say).

Blueprint 4.5: "Detectors live in Call Intelligence, outside the LLM:
age-related speech characteristics ... Acoustic features + lexical cues,
each with a confidence." This is that detector. It writes the `senior`
flag on CallState; agent/speech_policy.py then derives everything else
(slower rate, shorter sentences, one question at a time, echoing each
value) from Appendix C's table.

WHAT IS MEASURED
----------------
Age shows up in speech in ways that are individually weak and jointly
useful. Fundamental frequency is deliberately NOT one of them -- it moves
opposite ways for older men (up) and older women (down), so on its own it
identifies nothing. What is measured instead:

  syllable_rate     slower articulation
  pause_ratio       more, longer pauses inside the utterance
  f0_instability    cycle-to-cycle instability of the pitch track
                    (std of the detrended f0 in semitones)
  tremor_st         RMS pitch variation (semitones) in the 4-12 Hz band,
                    the physiological-tremor range
  harmonicity       lower periodicity / breathier voice

HOW SURE IT CAN BE -- read this before trusting a number
--------------------------------------------------------
There is no labelled age corpus in this repository, so the weights and
thresholds are REASONED from the speech-ageing literature and checked on
synthetic voices whose parameters are controlled (tests/test_senior_voice.py),
not fitted to Kolkata callers. Three things follow, on purpose:

  1. The cost is asymmetric, so the design is asymmetric. A false positive
     gives a younger caller a slower, more-confirming conversation -- mildly
     annoying. A false negative leaves an older caller with today's normal
     service -- no worse than before. So the thresholds lean conservative
     and a decision needs EVIDENCE OVER SEVERAL TURNS, not one clip.
  2. The acoustic estimate is one vote. An explicit request ("please speak
     slowly", "I am an old man") or a stated age of 60+ decides on its own,
     and is far stronger evidence than any of the above. The story says the
     mode "triggers on detection or request" -- both paths exist.
  3. Recalibrate on real, consented, labelled calls before trusting the
     acoustic path. Until then treat the estimate as a hint that shapes
     delivery, never as a fact about a person: nothing in the system states
     or stores an inferred age.

Persistence against the patient (KCD-084's last sentence) is the
clinic-api's job -- see clinic-api/booking_service.set_patient_senior; only
the boolean "delivery mode" is stored, never the score or any audio.
