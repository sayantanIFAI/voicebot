"""Choosing the language of a turn when language ID alone is not enough.

Measured on the pod (docs/adr/0002 records the numbers): SpeechBrain
VoxLingua107 separates Bengali from Hindi and Hindi from Bengali well, but
Indian-accented ENGLISH is routinely labelled Hindi, at high confidence. A
confident-looking wrong answer is worse than an unsure one: the router
commits to it and the caller is answered in the wrong language, so the
decision cannot rest on LID's top label alone.

The pieces here are deliberately small and pure so they are testable
without a GPU:

  pick_candidate choose between two ASR results for the same audio
  speakable      can a language's TTS voice actually say this text
