"""Rural lay terms for what a test is, matched deterministically to a CATEGORY -- never to a specific test name.

A caller who has never heard "CBC" or "USG" describes what the doctor wants checked, not the test's clinical name:
"rokto porikkha" (blood test), "peter chhobi" (a picture of the stomach), "mathar chhobi" (a picture of the head).
This module recognises the CATEGORY the phrase describes; agent/reply_templates.py's lay_term_reply() (or main.py,
for the blood list) turns that into an answer built from the REAL catalogue -- this file never states a test exists.

    BLOOD    -- every test the catalogue marks sample_type == "Blood"; ask which one (main.py lists them)
    ABDOMEN  -- resolves to the catalogue's Imaging test(s) whose name mentions the abdomen (today: USG Whole
                Abdomen); state it directly, there is nothing to ask
    HEAD     -- the catalogue has NO head/brain imaging test today (checked against the seeded data: only Chest
                X-Ray and USG Whole Abdomen exist under "Imaging"). Naming "brain scan" or "brain MRI" here would be
                exactly the fabricated fact CLAUDE.md's truth boundary exists to prevent -- a clinic that does not
                offer a service must never be told it does. So this category resolves to NOTHING; the caller is told
                to send the prescription so a colleague can check what the doctor actually wants (see main.py).

Phrases are matched in Bengali script (what a real caller's ASR transcript looks like), Devanagari, and the
phonetic-romanised Latin spelling the person who wrote this table typed it in -- kept because rural callers on a
poor line, or a WhatsApp/SMS channel, sometimes come through in Latin script too. REASONED, not measured: this list
has not been checked against a real call corpus; grow it from real transcripts once they exist (docs/transcription-
rulebook.md), and confirm with the clinic which imaging tests actually exist before this category list grows past
BLOOD/ABDOMEN (docs/REMINDERS-if-client-asks.md).
