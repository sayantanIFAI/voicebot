"""KCD-061: the call state object -- Blueprint 4.5's single, versioned
carrier of caller signals, read by every downstream policy/response
layer instead of each one re-deriving its own picture from scratch.

Written ONLY by call intelligence (this session's LID/ASR-confidence
work, and whatever Epic E?? empathy detectors land later -- see
CALLER_STATE_DEFAULT's docstring for what is real today vs. still a
placeholder). Read by policy/response layers (agent/reply_templates.py,
main.py's dispatch) -- never mutated by them.

Versioned (SCHEMA_VERSION) so a logged/serialized CallState from an
older build is recognisable rather than silently misread by a newer
reader with different field meanings.

No personal data lives here by construction -- every field is a signal
about HOW the caller is being served (language, confidence, a caller-
state category), never WHO they are (no name, phone, or transcript).
to_log_dict() exists anyway, and is the only sanctioned way to log a
CallState, so a future field addition cannot silently start leaking PII
into logs the way an ad-hoc dict.items() dump could.
