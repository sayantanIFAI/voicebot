"""A phonetic-fold gazetteer with an index (KCD-096).

WHAT WAS WRONG. Finding "who might the caller have meant" was a linear scan of every doctor and test row, once
with a consonant-skeleton comparison and once with `difflib.get_close_matches` over every name and alias, on every
lookup. Two things follow from that: the cost grows with the catalogue (a scan of a few thousand rows is felt on a
phone call), and the comparison was character-shaped, so a mispronunciation that keeps the consonants but drifts
the spelling ("Mukharji" for "Mukherjee") was found only when the skeleton matched EXACTLY and was at least three
classes long. "Sen", "Das", "Roy", "Kar" fold to one or two classes, so short names -- the commonest Bengali
surnames -- were never matched by sound at all.

WHAT THIS DOES. Every spoken form (a name, a surname, each Bengali and Hindi alias) is folded to phonemes ONCE, at
build time, and put in four inverted indexes. A query is folded the same way and looks up candidates, never scans:

    exact        the normalised written form itself                        (dict)
    sound        the same consonant skeleton (agent/phonetic_match.py)     (dict)
    sound, near  a skeleton one edit away: a dropped or added consonant    (symmetric-delete index)
    sound, short a one- or two-consonant name matched on consonants AND
                 coarse vowel quality ("Sen" = "Sain", not "Son")          (dict)
    spelling     shared character pairs, then difflib on the few sharing   (bigram index, top K)

Only the shortlist is scored, so the work per lookup follows the number of forms that SHARE something with the
query, not the size of the catalogue; `stats` counts how many were scored so that can be checked, not assumed.

WHAT IT IS NOT. It never resolves anything. The return value is a ranked list of "the caller might have meant"
for the agent to READ BACK; a sound-alike is never treated as the entity (CLAUDE.md, "Doctor Nobody"; the
clinic API resolves only on a written-form match). A fold throws information away, so every tier past `exact`
still has to clear a second, independent gate: a same-script character-similarity floor, or (across scripts,
where characters share nothing) a skeleton of at least three classes. A nonsense name that lands on nothing
returns an empty list.

REASONED, NOT MEASURED: every floor below was set from the synthetic mispronunciation set in
tools/gazetteer_eval.py, not from real callers. Recalibrate against real call transcripts before trusting them.

This file is byte-identical in agent/ and clinic-api/ (clinic-api is a separate service that never imports
agent/); tests/test_gazetteer.py fails if the two copies drift.
