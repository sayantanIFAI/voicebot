"""KCD-157: numbers spoken at a pace a caller can write down.

A phone number read as ten digits in one unbroken run is what makes a
caller ask twice. People dictate them in chunks, with a beat between
chunks -- "98765 ... 43210". This module owns that chunking, language-
neutrally (each language's own speller turns a chunk into words); the
verbalizers in bn_normalize.py and speech_norm.py join the chunks with a
standalone comma, which every FastPitch checkpoint here renders as a short
prosodic break.

Kept separate so the grouping rule exists in exactly one place and is
table-tested once, not re-derived per language.
