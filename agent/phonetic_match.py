"""Phonetic folding for name matching across Bengali, Devanagari and Latin
script (KCD-436).

The existing character-level fuzzy match (difflib.SequenceMatcher, in
clinic-api/main.py's _find_doctor) catches typo-distance errors but not
genuine mispronunciation: "Bhattacharya" heard and transcribed as
"Bhatacharjo" is a large character edit distance despite being the same
name said imperfectly. A pure phonetic fold, on its own, is exactly the
"Doctor Nobody" bug (CLAUDE.md section 1): folding throws away enough
information that unrelated short names can collide. So this module is
used as an ADDITIONAL gate, never a replacement -- a candidate must clear
BOTH the phonetic fold and the existing character-similarity floor before
it counts as a match. See clinic-api/main.py's _find_doctor.

Deliberately simple: consonant-class folding (classic Soundex idea) for
Latin script, and a matching consonant-class fold for the Bengali and
Devanagari consonant inventories, so a name folded in one script can be
compared against a name folded in another once both are transliterated
to the same class alphabet.

# Devanagari -- unicodedata.normalize("NFC", "ড়") actually DECOMPOSES
# the precomposed character to base consonant ড (U+09A1) + nukta (U+09BC),
# the opposite of what NFC normally does. So the _BENGALI_CLASS entry for
# the precomposed "ড়" key was dead code: every name this module ever
# folds has already gone through NFC by the time class-lookup runs, and
# NFC leaves that pair decomposed, never precomposed. Confirmed empirically:
#   unicodedata.normalize("NFC", "ড়") == "ড়"  (ড + nukta)
# The undetected consequence was silent misclassification, not a crash:
# the base consonant (ড, class "3") got folded on its own and the nukta
# was stripped as if it were a vowel sign, so "বড়ুয়া" (Barua) folded to
# the same key as any other class-3-initial name instead of matching
# "Barua"'s expected class-6 (র) key -- exactly the phonetic-match gap
# this module exists to close.
