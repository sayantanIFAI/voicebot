"""Answer the common turn without waking the 7B model.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Measuring the semantic cache produced a finding that reaches further than
caching. Against bge-m3 on real Bengali clinic questions:

    same question, reworded / ASR-garbled     cosine 0.78 - 0.82
    DIFFERENT test, same sentence frame       cosine 0.7492
    same entity, character-level comparison   0.696 - 1.000
    different entity, character-level          0.231 - 0.381

The embedding separates "which test" by 0.03. Character overlap separates
it by 0.32 -- an order of magnitude better, because the embedding is
dominated by the sentence frame ("X টেস্টের রেট কত") while the part that
decides which price a patient is quoted is a handful of characters.

Follow that through and the conclusion is not "tune the cache". It is
that for a fixed 74-row catalogue, identifying the entity was never a
language-modelling problem. A caller asking "ইউরিক অ্যাসিড টেস্টের রেট কত"
needs two things recognised: an intent drawn from a set of four, and one
row out of 74. Both are decidable locally, in microseconds, with a wider
correctness margin than the 7B model's output was ever checked against.

So the LLM is demoted to what it is genuinely needed for: utterances this
module is NOT confident about.

Extended beyond price/availability to also cover test preparation
("test_prep") and a small fixed set of clinic FAQ topics ("clinic_faq" --
hours, location, payment, insurance, parking, report collection, contact
number, home collection): same reasoning, same commit-floor discipline,
same abstain-when-ambiguous default. See Catalogue's docstring for the
FAQ table's shape and its growth limit.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY REFUSES
----------------------------
`book_appointment` always goes to the LLM. It needs a date, a time, a
patient name and a phone number pulled out of free speech -- open-ended
extraction with caller-specific data in it, which is exactly the case
where a pattern-matcher's failure mode is silent and wrong. The fast path
handles the questions with one entity and no PII, and hands over anything
else. Abstaining is a first-class result here, not a failure.

PER LANGUAGE (KCD-095)
----------------------
The cue words that say "this is a price question" live in agent/fast_path_cues.py, one table per language behind one
interface; `resolve(text, lang)` uses the table for `lang` and abstains for a language it has none for (including
"unknown"). Serve rate is counted per language and `snapshot()["language_gap"]` flags a gap wider than
LANGUAGE_GAP_MARGIN as a defect. Adding a language is a `fast_path_cues.register(...)` call plus catalogue columns,
not code.

FAST AT ANY CATALOGUE SIZE (KCD-096)
------------------------------------
Matching used to score every form against every word-window with difflib: 17-156 ms per turn at 74 rows and seconds
at thousands. It now goes through agent/form_index.py: an exact pruning step (a proven upper bound skips comparisons
that cannot reach the commit floor; results at or above the floor are unchanged) and, on large tables only, a bigram
shortlist whose only failure mode is an abstain. The commit gate stays a CHARACTER similarity on purpose: a
fast-path answer has no model behind it, and a sound-alike is a suggestion for the caller to confirm
(agent/gazetteer.py), never evidence to act on.
