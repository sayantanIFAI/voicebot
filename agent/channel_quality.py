"""KCD-075: classify each call's audio into the annotation vocabulary --
clean 16 kHz, narrowband 8 kHz, noisy, or cross-talk -- so live traffic
can be compared against the evaluation population's own labelled
distribution (the whole point of a shared vocabulary: a live "noisy"
rate that drifts from the eval set's is a real, actionable signal, and
comparing them needs both sides using the same four labels).

Deterministic signal processing on the decoded PCM, no model call --
this has to run inside KCD-076's per-call latency slice alongside the
other call-intelligence detectors, so it is FFT/energy arithmetic on a
single utterance clip, not a classifier that needs a GPU.

Bandwidth (clean vs narrowband) is judged from the actual FREQUENCY
CONTENT, not the file's declared sample rate: a telephone leg often
arrives as 8 kHz-bandlimited audio stored/upsampled into a 16 kHz
container, and the container's own sample_rate field would call that
"clean" when the content is not.

Noisy vs clean is a coarse energy-percentile SNR estimate. Cross-talk
detection is the weakest of the four by a wide margin -- there is no
real overlapping-speaker corpus locally to calibrate against, so it is
a conservative, explicitly-labelled HEURISTIC (see classify_channel's
docstring), the same "reasoned, not measured" caveat this codebase
already carries on agent/fast_path.py's FAQ_COMMIT_FLOOR and
agent/confidence_gate.py's threshold -- recalibrate against real call
audio before trusting it past the pilot.
