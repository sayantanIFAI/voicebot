"""Cross-turn booking state (Epic E26).

The gap this file exists to close: before this, main.py's dispatch threw
the ENTIRE turn's slots away and re-prompted from scratch whenever one
required slot was missing (see main.py's book_appointment branch history)
-- so a caller who gave doctor, date and time in one sentence but not a
phone number would be asked for the doctor's name again on the very next
turn. That is KCD-357/358/366's "no cross-turn slot memory" repo evidence.

BookingState is attached to a CallSession (main.py) and MERGES each
turn's newly-extracted slots into what earlier turns already gave,
instead of replacing them. It never talks to clinic-api itself and never
touches the network or a database -- that stays in agent/tools_client.py
and main.py, keeping this module pure and unit-testable, per CLAUDE.md's
one-import rule (nothing here imports main.py).

Deliberately NOT using the LLM to decide "was that a yes" -- a caller
confirming a booking is exactly the kind of binary, high-stakes decision
this project's whole architecture exists to keep deterministic (see
CLAUDE.md's truth boundary) and fast (zero extra round trip to Qwen).
