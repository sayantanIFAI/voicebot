"""Kinder, slower service for a senior citizen (KCD-512).

The age comes from the REGISTERED date of birth, computed on the server after the caller passed the
security questions (clinic-api/registry.py returns `age_years` and `is_senior`, 60 and over, which is
India's definition of a senior citizen). It is NOT inferred from the voice: agent/senior_voice.py's
acoustic cues stay a weak hint that never overrides this. Once the registry says senior, the call
switches to senior care for its remaining turns:

  * the SPEECH POLICY row (agent/speech_policy.py): slower rate, one question at a time, longer
    pauses -- set through `apply_caller_state(senior=True)`;
  * a WARM OPENING, once, right after the check: thank them, tell them there is no hurry;
  * a WARM CLOSING on some answers, so the caller is invited to ask more without being pressed;
  * more PATIENCE when a turn fails: a re-ask carries "there is no hurry" too;
  * the same respectful "you" (आप / আপনি) as everyone -- kindness is warmth and patience, never
    baby talk or a change of register (agent/persona.py still applies).

`KindnessPlanner` decides WHICH of these a given reply gets, deterministically, so it is warm without
being smothering: the opening once, the closing on every second substantive reply, the patience line
on a re-ask, and nothing on a one-word reply. It adds no fact and no advice, and every line is a
fixed string with no digit or name. Wording is provisional and pending native review.
