"""KCD-149: speech policy derived from call state.

Blueprint 4.5 and Appendix C: a deterministic table maps the caller's
state to HOW the agent talks -- speech rate, sentence length, questions
per turn, confirmation style, interruption tolerance, escalation
threshold. Empathy is driven by these rules, not by asking a model to "be
empathetic". The values below are Appendix C's table row for row.

This system's replies are templates (agent/reply_templates.py), and the
model only ever extracts intent, so "hard constraints for the planner"
means two concrete things here: the rate goes to synthesis
(main.py's _speak), and the question count / sentence length / echo rules
are enforced on the reply before it is spoken (check_reply). A future
planner that DOES compose wording inherits the same constraints through
hard_constraints().

Precedence when several states apply at once (an older caller who is also
distressed): the most conservative value of every field wins -- slowest
rate, shortest sentences, fewest questions, the strongest confirmation,
the lowest escalation threshold. Emergency overrides everything and stops
the normal flow.
