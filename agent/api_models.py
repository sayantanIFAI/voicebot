"""The shape of what the clinic API may answer, checked where the answer enters the agent (agent/tools_client.py).

The agent states facts from these answers (a price, a time, a confirmation number), so an answer of the wrong shape must
not be spoken from: it is a tool failure ("I can't check that right now"), never a half-understood reply. Each model:

  * requires the ONE field the agent branches on (`found`, `success`, `status`, `matched`, `conflict`, `verified`) with the
    right type, so a body like {"error": "..."} or an HTML error page is rejected instead of read as "not found";
  * types the fields the reply templates rely on (a price is a number, a list of slots is a list of strings);
  * allows every other field (`extra="allow"`), because the API adds fields and the agent must not break when it does.

`validated(model, payload, what)` returns a plain dict of exactly the keys the API sent (unset fields are not invented),
so nothing downstream changes.
