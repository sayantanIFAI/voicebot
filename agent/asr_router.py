"""Routes one utterance to its language-specific ASR engine.

Pilot architecture (docs/adr/0001-pilot-single-l4-architecture.md): three
ASR checkpoints stay resident on the one production GPU simultaneously --
never unloaded/reloaded on a language switch, because a model-load stall
mid-call is worse than the small fixed VRAM cost of keeping all three warm.
For any one utterance, exactly one (or, on `dual_asr`, two) is actually
run. This module is the "exactly one" part: a plain registry keyed by
language, with the actual engines injected rather than imported, so the
routing decision is unit-testable with fakes and carries no GPU, torch or
NeMo dependency of its own.

Engine construction (loading IndicConformer-bn, IndicConformer-hi, or the
NVIDIA FastConformer English checkpoint) belongs to whoever wires this
router at process startup -- see agent/asr.py for the proven bn loading
shape; hi and en checkpoints are new and unverified off-pod, same caveat
as agent/lid.py.
