"""Admission control for AI voice calls.

The rule this enforces (docs/adr/0001, section 5; Blueprint Appendix A/B):
a call the AI cannot serve well goes to a person, immediately. It is never
queued behind the GPU. An unbounded queue turns an overloaded system into a
system where EVERY caller hears dead air; a refused call gets a human.

What can close the door, in priority order:

  bypass       An operator forced human-only mode (the RFP's audited AI
               kill-switch). Two ways to flip it, both without a deploy: the
               flag file (`touch` it) and set_bypass() behind the HTTP
               endpoint in main.py. Either one is enough; the file is
               checked on every admit so it works even if the process's own
               control plane is wedged.
  backend_down A model service the call cannot complete without has failed
               its health probes (see HealthMonitor). "GPU loss lowers
               capacity to zero" -- there is no partial credit for a call
               that will hit a dead TTS on its first reply.
  latency_shed Recent turn latency is over budget. Existing calls keep going;
               NEW calls are refused until p95 recovers. This is the
               "latency-aware" part: the GPU can be saturated long before any
               counter reaches the cap, and turn latency is what a caller
               actually feels.
  capacity     max_calls reached.

Pure logic plus one small async health poller: no model, no audio. Everything
here is unit-tested (tests/test_admission.py) with an injected clock.

What this does NOT do: transfer a live call. Moving a SIP call to the contact
centre happens in the SBC layer, outside this repository. This module makes
the decision and emits it (main.py sends a `handoff_human` frame on the
socket); the telephony bridge acts on that frame.
