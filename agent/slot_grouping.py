"""Ask for several booking details in one question, except when the caller's state says one at a time (KCD-103).

THE PROBLEM. `missing_slot_prompt` asked for exactly one field per turn, always. A caller who says "I want to book
Dr. Sen" was then asked the day, then the time, then the name, then the phone number: five turns and four "who
are you calling for" pauses to book one appointment. Callers who know all of it were interrogated.

THE RULE. Ask the next GROUP of missing fields in one question (the day and the time together; the name and the
number together), and accept any subset back -- the merge in agent/booking_flow.py takes whatever the extractor
found and the next turn asks for what is still missing. Two things always win over grouping:

  * The caller-state table (agent/speech_policy.py). A senior caller, a distressed caller and an emergency
    are held to `questions_per_turn` = 1 or 0 ("one question, listen, confirm, next"), and this module returns
    exactly one field for them, whatever the group would have been. Grouping is a convenience for a caller who
    can take it; it is never a reason to load one who cannot.
  * A field already asked once. If the caller did not answer a grouped question fully, the leftover fields are
    asked one at a time: repeating the same long question at someone who has just shown it did not land is the
    fastest way to lose them.

A grouped prompt is ONE question sentence (one question mark), so it satisfies `check_reply` for the normal policy,
which allows two per turn. Wording per language is in the tables below; the fragments are joined into a natural
clause, never a "label: value" pair (KCD-454). Adding a group or a language is data.

REASONED, NOT MEASURED: which fields belong together is a judgement about what a caller knows at once (a day and a
time; their own name and number), not a measurement; "median turns to complete a booking falls" is shown on
scripted callers in tests/test_slot_grouping.py, not on real ones.
