"""Listen to the caller, not the room (KCD-053, KCD-055).

Once the call has heard its caller for a turn or two, it knows two things about them: HOW LOUD they
speak into this handset and at what PITCH (agent/near_end.py's NearEndProfile). Everything in the
audio that is far below that level is not the caller, and this module turns the two facts into a
gain envelope, frame by frame (10 ms):

  * a BACKGROUND VOICE frame -- voiced, at least BACKGROUND_DELTA_DB below the caller's level, and at
    a pitch more than DIFFERENT_VOICE_F0_RATIO away from theirs -- is someone else in the room;
  * a NOISE frame -- not voiced (no pitch), at least NOISE_DELTA_DB below the caller's level and not
    within 80 ms of their voiced speech -- is the fan, the street, the hiss between phrases. This is the noise-suppression half (KCD-055): a gate
    keyed to the caller's OWN level rather than to a generic noise estimate, which is why it can
    be aggressive about noise without touching the caller's quiet consonants (those sit within a
    few dB of their voiced level, far above the gate);
  * everything else -- the caller, and any frame we cannot classify -- is left EXACTLY as it was.

Frames that qualify are ATTENUATED (ATTENUATION_DB), not deleted, and the gain moves smoothly (a short
ramp) so there are no clicks. Nothing is ever amplified.

GUARDS. It does nothing at all until the profile is established (the first utterance of a call is
passed through untouched). If more than MAX_FRACTION of an utterance would be attenuated, something is
off (the caller moved away, or the profile is stale) and the clip is returned unchanged. And the
frames it may touch are defined by exclusion, so speech at the caller's own level cannot be
attenuated by construction; tests/test_attention.py checks that on synthetic callers, bystanders and
noise, and reports the measured effect. Those numbers are synthetic; how much a recogniser benefits
on real audio is measured by tools/conditioning_eval.py on a pod.

Pure numpy.
