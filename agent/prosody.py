"""KCD-162: clause-level prosody with punctuation-aware pauses.

The pure half of tts_server.py -- how a reply is split into chunks, how
long a pause each chunk earns, how ragged padding is trimmed and how the
level is normalised. It lives here, numpy-only, rather than inside
tts_server.py because that file loads three GPU synthesizers and changes
its working directory at import, so nothing in it can be unit tested off a
pod. tts_server.py keeps only the part that genuinely needs the models:
calling synth.tts() once per chunk.

tts_server.py runs in its own venv (coqui-tts and the NeMo fork cannot
share one) but deploy/env.sh puts the repo root on PYTHONPATH, so this
module imports there as `agent.prosody`. It must stay free of anything
beyond numpy and the standard library for exactly that reason.

Every value in ProsodyParams is overridable per request (see
resolve_params) and range-checked, so delivery can be A/B tested against a
real handset without a redeploy -- the story's own requirement.
