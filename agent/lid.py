"""Per-utterance language identification, ahead of ASR.

Pilot architecture change (2026-09-15, supersedes the transcript-based LID
in the Architecture & Implementation Plan Section 10): once the agent
routes each utterance to ONE of three language-specific ASR engines
(agent/asr_router.py), the language decision can no longer be made by
reading the ASR transcript -- there is no transcript yet. LID must run on
the AUDIO, before ASR. See docs/adr/0001-pilot-single-l4-architecture.md.

This module is split in two, deliberately:

  - `LanguageIdentifier` is the audio-level model boundary. The pilot
    architecture names SpeechBrain's VoxLingua107 ECAPA-TDNN model
    (bn/hi/en, 16 kHz mono, ~86 MB, CPU-only) as the first implementation
    to try. `SpeechBrainVoxLingua107LID` below has the loading/inference
    shape for it, but IT IS UNVERIFIED -- it has not been run against a
    live model or real audio, because no pod was available when this was
    written. Do not trust it until it has been exercised on the pod; see
    the class docstring.

  - `ASRLanguageRouter` is pure orchestration logic: no model, no audio,
    no I/O. It takes whatever LID confidence you have plus the call's
    running state and decides what to DO about it -- commit to a
    language, run a second ASR for this turn, ask the caller to repeat,
    or give up and hand the call to a human. This half is fully unit
    tested without a GPU, a pod, or even SpeechBrain installed -- see
    tests/test_lid.py, which passes today, on this machine, with nothing
    but the standard library.

Keep language PER UTTERANCE, never latched for the call: a caller may use
Bengali grammar with an English test name, switch to Hindi next turn, then
read a phone number in English.

    class is trusted in the call path:

      1. `pip install speechbrain` on the pod (CPU is fine -- the model
         is ~86 MB and the pilot architecture explicitly keeps LID off
         the GPU so the GPU stays free for the six speech models).

         installed version -- verify against the live model, not this
