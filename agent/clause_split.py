"""KCD-462: "the first clause is emitted as soon as it renders... a
preparation instruction of four sentences begins within the first-audio
budget."

Splits a reply into clauses at the SAME sentence-final boundaries
prosody already treats as natural pause points ("।" the Bengali danda,
and ".", "?", "!" for Hindi/English) -- not a new segmentation scheme,
just reusing the boundary a native reader already hears as one. main.py's
_speak() synthesizes and sends each clause as its own short TTS call
instead of one call for the whole reply, so the first clause reaches the
caller's ear as soon as ITS OWN (much shorter) synthesis finishes,
instead of waiting for the entire reply to render first.
