"""The caller wants the call to end -- decided by words, not by the model.

A live call (2026-09-25): the agent asked "anything else? if not I will end the call", the caller said "শেষ করে দিন"
("finish it / end it"), and the agent went to the model, which heard a booking request and asked for a confirmation number.
Ending a call is a binary, low-risk, high-annoyance decision: it is decided here, deterministically, with no model.

Two strengths of cue, because the same words mean different things in different places:

  * EXPLICIT -- unmistakable at any moment: "end the call", "কল কেটে দিন", "फोन रखता हूँ", "goodbye". Mid-booking too;
    the unfinished booking is saved for the next call (main._save_unfinished_draft).
  * WHEN ASKED -- only as the answer to "is there anything else?": a bare "শেষ করে দিন", "nothing", "that's all",
    "no thanks". The same words mid-booking ("finish the booking") are not a request to hang up.

Whole-token matching for short cues (a substring hit would fire "bye" inside "maybe"), substring matching for longer
Bengali phrases (Bengali is written without spaces between a word and its endings). REASONED cue lists, not measured;
a native speaker should review them (docs/pod-verification-checklist.md).
